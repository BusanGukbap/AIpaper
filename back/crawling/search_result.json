            "body": "President Joe Biden is expected to meet Tuesday with congressional leaders on the debt ceiling limit following \"productive\" staff-level negotiations over the weekend, two sources familiar with the talks told CNN on Sunday, as the US barrels toward a deadline that could come as soon as June 1. Negotiators have been able to pinpoint some areas on which congressional staff and the White House can find common ground, including revising the permitting process, rescinding unspent Covid-19 relief funds and potentially cutting spending, the sources said.  Biden and the top four congressional leaders -- House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell -- held talks on the debt limit last week in the Oval Office. Tuesday's meeting, which has not yet been officially confirmed, according to the sources, comes after a planned Friday meeting was postponed as the staff-level talks continued.  Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union\" on Sunday that talks between the two sides have been \"constructive.\"  Biden, Adeyamo said, \"looks forward to getting together with the leaders to talk about how we continue to make progress.\"  Biden himself indicated on Sunday that he expected principal-level debt ceiling discussions to take place Tuesday.  \"We're working on it right now,\" he said in brief remarks to reporters as he completed a bike ride in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. There is still not a clear path forward to avoid a default with just four more days before June 1 when both the House and Senate are scheduled to be in session. Biden also confirmed Sunday that he expects to depart Wednesday for Hiroshima, Japan, for the G7 summit. \"That's my plan as it stands now,\" he told reporters in Rehoboth Beach. It's become increasingly clear that some spending cuts must be included for a deal to materialize, one of the sources said, and that point of discussion has been the main sticking point in negotiations so far. Biden said Sunday that he was waiting to hear Republicans' exact proposals on work requirements for certain government aid programs. He said he has voted in the past for \"tougher aid programs\" that are now law but \"for Medicaid, it's a different story.\" White House spokesperson Michael Kikukawa later elaborated on the president's answer, saying in a statement that Biden would evaluate the GOP proposals guided by the principle that they would \"not take away people's health coverage\" or \"push Americans into poverty.\" Negotiators recognize they will likely need to have an outline of a deal by the end of the week to ensure a bill can pass through Congress by June 1, the sources said, but they also think there are potential congressional tools that can be used to speed up the process if needed. The sources did not specify what those tools are. Adeyemo reiterated Sunday that the US \"can't\" default on its debt but declined to provide details on areas of agreement. He echoed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's assessment that default could happen \"as early as June 1\" but said it \"can be sometime in early June,\" calling on Congress to act as he warned that default would be \"catastrophic.\" Pressed by Bash on the timing of a deal following McCarthy's call for an agreement in principle by early this week and business leaders like JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon warning of market panic in the absence of a deal, Adeyemo said Biden \"believes we should raise the debt limit as soon as possible.\" \"Because it's not only financial markets, but the (University of Michigan) survey of consumer sentiment last week showed that consumers are now worried about the debt limit -- it's affecting the way they're spending,\" Adeyemo said. Meanwhile, top Biden economic adviser Lael Brainard on Sunday echoed previous White House comments on preferring a whole deal rather than a short-term fix. \"Short-term is not a fix. It is not really addressing that core uncertainty that CEOs are talking about. It's just really important to take default and address it, and Congress has the tools to do that,\" the director of the National Economic Council said on \"Face the Nation\" on CBS. Biden expressed optimism Sunday for an eventual agreement. \"I remain optimistic because I'm a congenital optimist. But I really think there's a desire on their part, as well as ours, to reach an agreement. I think we'll be able to do it,\" he said in Rehoboth Beach. The president had indicated last week that he was prepared for talks to go down to the wire.  \"I've been involved in negotiations my whole career,\" he told CNN during a trip to New York. \"Some negotiations happen at the last second, some negotiations happen way ahead of time. So, we'll see.\" Biden resurfaced last week the controversial idea of lifting the borrowing cap without Congress by invoking the 14th Amendment, which some legal experts argue gives the president the authority to order the nation's debts to be paid regardless of the debt limit Congress sets. But using the 14th Amendment to let the Treasury Department borrow above the debt ceiling to pay the nation's obligations would almost certainly prompt a constitutional crisis and swift legal action.  Asked Sunday whether the administration would consider invoking the 14th Amendment in the absence of a deal with Congress, Adeyemo said, \"What the president said was that he did not think the 14th Amendment would solve our problems now. The only thing that can solve our problems now is for Congress to lift the debt limit.\" This story and headline have been updated. ",

            "body": "Growing up in North Carolina, Kevin Lambert knew he was different from his White peers. The Korean features he inherited from his mother stood out, and he \"always felt outcast, always felt outside.\"  \"All my childhood, in the '80s and '90s, all I got was: 'Hey, are you Chinese? Do you know kung fu?'\" he said.  That uneasy, ill-fitting feeling lingered into adulthood -- pushing him to move to South Korea in 2009, hoping to find \"the missing puzzle piece behind the couch that makes the sky complete.\"  He's one of many Asian Americans born or raised in the United States, whose parents immigrated to the US decades ago, leaving behind a poor postwar South Korea in pursuit of the American Dream -- only to see the next generation make the reverse journey back.  It might seem an odd desire given many have never set foot in South Korea. But the lure of acceptance and belonging in an ancestral homeland is strong, particularly when set against the racism, gun violence, and anti-Asian hate crimes rampant in the US. These return migrants largely grew up in a time when many Americans' general knowledge about Asia was limited to Japan and China, and even then, revolved around offensive stereotypes, said Stephen Cho Suh, assistant professor of Asian American studies at San Diego State University. That experience of being racialized and not seen as fully American pushed many to look toward their parents' homeland \"in ways that, if (they) were wholly accepted in US society, (they) might not even consider in the first place,\" Suh said. But life in South Korea brings its own challenges -- and many eventually return to the US. Some find that as Korean Americans with a foot in each world, even moving thousands of miles away brings them no closer to finding home.  'Everyone mentions race' Various factors have driven this reverse migration. In 1999, South Korea passed a law opening its doors to \"overseas Koreans,\" including children of immigrants, making it easier for them to return and stay for longer periods of time.  The 2002 FIFA World Cup hosted by South Korea and Japan, and the Great Recession from 2007 to 2009, when many took jobs teaching English in South Korean schools to escape the US' dire job market, also played a part. But there's one overarching factor, said Suh, who interviewed more than 70 people as part of his research into reverse migration: \"Everyone mentions race, racism, ethnicity.\" After Daniel Oh immigrated from South Korea with his family as a young child, he moved to Canada then the US, where casual racism was a daily reality. Now 32, Oh remembers \"so many instances where I felt ashamed of being an immigrant.\" \"I tried to get away from my foreign-ness a lot,\" he said. But \"no matter how well you speak English, how many cultural references you know, how assimilated you are in behavior and speech ... still on the outside, you're at best Asian American.\" When he began visiting Korea in his 20s, his birth country had changed dramatically from the little he remembered. He wasn't fully comfortable speaking Korean. And yet, \"in a way, it (did) feel like home,\" he said. Things that had set him apart in the US -- parts of his personality and mannerisms, his sense of identity -- \"made a lot more sense when I was back in Korea.\"  The pull grew stronger with each trip -- until, at age 24, he moved to Seoul, where he has lived for the past eight years.  Many migrants enjoy a \"honeymoon phase\" when they delight in blending into a crowd of Korean faces and feel a sense of belonging, said Ji-Yeon O. Jo, director of the Carolina Asia Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. There are economic motivations too. Several Korean American musicians have found stardom in South Korea's exploding K-pop industry -- Tiffany, Jessica and Sunny from Girls' Generation, and soloists Eric Nam and Jessi, for instance. There are few Korean American pop stars of equivalent fame in the US, Jo said, suggesting \"the invisible bamboo ceiling is very real.\" Original immigrants look to retire It's not just the children of immigrants moving back: many first generation Korean Americans are too. Kim Moon-kuk, 72, immigrated from Seoul to Los Angeles in 1985 with his wife and two children. He operated several businesses over the decades, including a restaurant, flea market, gold and silver shop, and a sewing factory. But he and his wife moved back to South Korea in 2020, settling in the northern city of Chuncheon. The benefits, he said, were plentiful: affordable healthcare, ease of communicating in Korean and closeness to family. Back in the US, racism had been an ugly and constant danger. He recalls stopping by a bar in the '90s with White patrons lined up outside, and being turned away \"because it's members only.\"  But his strongest memories are of the 1992 LA riots, sparked by the acquittal of four White LAPD officers charged over the beating of Black motorist Rodney King. Dozens of people were killed in the ensuing violence, while looting, armed assaults and arson caused approximately $1 billion in damage, about half of which was sustained by Korean-owned businesses. Long-simmering tensions between immigrant Korean business owners and predominantly Black customers spilled over. For much of the riots, law enforcement was nowhere to be seen in the burning Koreatown -- leaving shop owners and residents like Kim to fend for themselves. More recently, he said, \"Asians' lives had gotten difficult\" during the Trump era, with the former president repeatedly calling Covid-19 the \"China virus\" and \"kung flu.\" Reports of anti-Asian hate incidents spiked. For Kim, it's a relief to be back in South Korea, where the safety is \"100% better.\" \"I plan to live (in South Korea) until I die,\" he said. This desire is widespread among aging Korean Americans, assistant professor Suh said, but not everyone is able to make the move. After decades away, many have lost touch with family and friends, or feel too old to make the journey. Those that do make it might not even recognize the country today. While South Korea has developed at breakneck speed in recent decades, the cost of living has skyrocketed, too. Finding a 'mirror image of racism' The homecoming many migrants imagine rarely matches the reality. After the honeymoon phase wears off, many start to see conflicts between \"everyday Korean living\" and \"the values and lifestyles they are very used to in the US,\" Jo said. Even routine tasks like finding an apartment, setting up a bank account, and registering with a physician are complicated by language barriers and unfamiliar protocols. \"One of the hardest things about being Korean American back in Korea is there's a bit of double standard,\" said Oh. \"You're foreigner in some ways ... and then you're supposed to be more Korean, when other non-Korean foreigners would get a pass.\"  It felt like an extra hurdle \"to feel like you did a good enough job of being Korean,\" he added. It's a common sentiment: many report getting strange looks when speaking English on public transport, said Jo. Some are even confronted by strangers asking, \"You're Korean, why can't you speak Korean?\" Or, when stumbling over medical terminology in doctors' offices, they are asked: \"Aren't you Korean?\" In some ways, these experiences echo what their parents faced when they immigrated to the US. \"We see a mirror image of racism -- in this case, intra-ethnic (discrimination) based on the country of citizenship, but in the US it's interracial racism,\" Jo said. \"The dynamics are a bit different,\" but there are close similarities in how they manifest in everyday life. Moments like these are what drove Lambert back to the US in 2020, after 11 years in South Korea.  \"As a society, you are not welcome there,\" he said. \"The policies say you're not welcome. The visas say you're not welcome. The way they treat workers says you're not welcome.\" Challenges pile up There are other reasons some reverse migrants end up returning to the US. It's hard to maintain relationships with loved ones back home. Dating can be tough. Many women end up clashing with South Korea's conservative gender and dating norms, which deem them \"too outspoken ... not demure enough, too feminist,\" Suh said. Meanwhile, men may have trouble finding partners if they don't \"have employment in desirable jobs.\" Employment is perhaps the biggest challenge. Teaching jobs are easy to find, but switching to a different industry is harder. Whether because of their background or visa status, Korean Americans may face discrimination by employers in other fields, Suh said. Afraid of missing out on career opportunities back home, Oh is now considering returning to the US.  \"My parents worked so hard to bring me to America,\" he said, adding he felt a certain \"duty to take what you have been given and make something out of it.\" Besides, Oh said, life in Seoul as a Korean American felt like one of diminishing returns. \"Early on, more time spent in Korea felt linearly like returning to Korean-ness. Then after a while, you start to be like, oh, there's sort of a ceiling to how much of Korea I can actually return to,\" he said.  While his friends and families moved on with their lives in the US, \"I didn't feel that an equivalent amount of things were opening up for me in Korea ... You get less and less out of it as time goes.\" Even first-generation Korean Americans may struggle to adjust to a country so different to the one they left. Lambert's mother remembers Korea as a land of struggle; her father died in the Korean War, her mother died of cancer without access to doctors, and she made a living by carrying rocks out from under destroyed bridges.  By contrast, the Korea she visited decades later was covered in LED screens, developed infrastructure, clean streets and the markings of modernity. With each trip back, \"she felt a little bit more disassociated from Korea,\" Lambert said. Kim was also stunned by the change. The rice paddies he once passed on the way to school have been replaced by a Samsung semiconductor factory. He struggles sometimes with the ubiquitous phone apps and automated shop kiosks; he misses traveling the vast open country. But, unlike Oh and Lambert, he has no qualms about staying. In fact, had he known the country would become so developed, he might never have left in the first place. \"If South Korea today was as impoverished as it was when I left, why would I return?\" he said. \"I came (back) because it's as rich as the US.\" Neither here nor there Many younger Korean Americans walk away with a different view of their own identity after migrating. Suh said some felt a heightened awareness of their American identities when they \"recognize that (they're) not Korean in the ways South Koreans define Korean-ness.\" This in-betweenness is particularly common among Korean Americans, who often \"want to straddle\" the two countries and ",

            "body": "The expiration of a Covid-related border restriction policy known as Title 42 has so far brought fewer migrant arrivals than expected, but southern border communities still worry about overcrowded migrant processing and detention facilities. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Sunday the number of migrants at the US southern border \"are markedly down over what they were prior to the end of Title 42.\" Title 42, a controversial Trump-era policy from the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, allowed authorities to swiftly turn away migrants encountered at the US-Mexico border. The policy ended Thursday night along with the national coronavirus public health emergency.  The mayor of Laredo, Texas, told CNN's Jim Acosta that even though the number of people coming in may be lower than what federal officials were bracing for, his community is still on \"high alert.\" \"The unfortunate reality is that we were already at near capacity in our hospitals before Title 42 expired and without a pediatric intensive care unit,\" Mayor Victor Trevi\u00f1o, who is a physician, said. \"We wouldn't be able to care for some of the arriving children and family groups.\" His community received about 700 migrants on Saturday, the mayor said. \"We're still on high alert because Brownsville and El Paso still have a high number there with them so we have to be cognizant of that,\" he added.  Officials had warned the end of Title 42 could result in a migrant surge that would exacerbate an already challenging humanitarian crisis at the southern border. Federal and local authorities prepared for an influx, with thousands of personnel from federal agencies dispatched to the border to support local authorities. Authorities had projected migrant encounters to surge to an average of 2,000-14,000 a day, said one official, Matthew J. Hudak, deputy chief of the US Border Patrol.  \"It's not the numbers we initially expected, and we hope it keeps that way,\" said Mayor Javier Villalobos of McAllen, which sits along the US-Mexico border in South Texas. In El Paso -- which has seen hundreds of migrants sleeping on sidewalks after a recent spike in arrivals -- Mayor Oscar Leeser said the city has so far seen a \"smooth transition\" out of Title 42 but is still preparing for what the future may hold. \"We know that we still need to prepare for the unknown because we don't know what's going to happen next week and continue to happen day in and day out,\" Lesser said. His community is currently getting the resources it needs from the state and federal government, he said on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday. \"We all know the immigration process is broken, there's no ifs and buts about it, but we are getting the resources that we need because our city and the southern border couldn't do it without federal aid,\" Leeser said. While border officials did not see a substantial influx of migrants Friday, US authorities warn that detention facilities could still become dangerously overcrowded. As of Friday afternoon, about 23,400 migrants were in Border Patrol custody, slightly lower than earlier in the week, according to a Homeland Security official. What the migrants say Many who head to the US make long and dangerous journeys in hopes of finding better, safer lives. Experts say migrants could be fleeing violence, immigrating for economic opportunities or to reunite with family members. Thousands of migrants for weeks took refuge around El Paso's Sacred Heart Church ahead of the expiration of Title 42. Father Rafael Garcia, the pastor at the church, said the numbers of migrants have dwindled in the past few days. \"The numbers have really gone down,\" Garcia told CNN's Jim Acosta on Saturday. \"I don't have answers, but the fact is around our church and even within our shelter, our numbers have gone down and we're taking it day by day. \" The majority of migrants his church has encountered recently had traveled from Venezuela, where some described struggling to survive on the equivalent of $5 to $10 a month, the pastor said. \"It's not an easy decision for them to come, but they all believe they cannot survive back home,\" he added. \"Their desire, typically from everybody, they say 'I want to work. I want to be able to start a new life. I want to send money back to family still in Venezuela.' That's pretty much the common theme.\" Migrants arriving at the El Paso church also describe a dangerous journey to get there, Garcia said.  \"Some have been kidnapped, some have been harassed in different ways,\" he said.  Those arriving at his church include injured people who need emergency care, Garcia said, as well as pregnant mothers in their third trimester of pregnancy, who have made the arduous trek through Mexico for a chance to immigrate to the US.  \"It's a real crisis. It's a real human crisis,\" he said. \"To do this, it must be a real serious need to say, 'I have to leave my country. I can no longer be there,'\" the pastor said. \"That has to be taken into account.\" Those who make it to a border checkpoint arrive not knowing whether they will qualify for asylum or be sent back to Mexico or their home countries.  What happens next With Title 42 now expired, US authorities are leaning more on Title 8, a decades-old protocol for asylum seekers which could carry lengthier processing times and more severe consequences for those crossing unlawfully. The federal plan was dealt a setback Thursday when a federal judge in Florida temporarily blocked the Biden administration from releasing migrants from Border Patrol without court notices. The ruling impedes a key administration tool for managing the number of migrants in US custody. Hudak warned in the filing that without measures to conditionally release some migrants, Border Patrol could have over 45,000 migrants in custody by the end of the month. \"Noncitizens held in overcrowded facilities are not only vulnerable to communicable diseases, but this vulnerability is likely to be compounded by some aspects of the noncitizens' journey including poor health and nutrition, lack of access to health care, and/or inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene services while migrating to the Southwest border,\" the filing says.",

            "body": "Wall Street is eager to see the Federal Reserve wind down its aggressive rate-hiking cycle that's battered markets and tested investor morale. Although a pause in interest rate hikes appears likely, cuts may be farther off than some believe. The stock market has stayed resilient this year after a brutal 2022 that was roiled by persistent inflation, the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes, Covid shutdowns and geopolitical tensions.  Still, investors have remained hyper-alert for signs that the central bank could let up its brisk clip of interest rate increases. The Fed issued its tenth consecutive rate hike this May, raising rates by a quarter point. The central bank also opened the door to a pause, accelerating bets that the Fed will hold rates steady at its next meeting in June and cut rates as soon as July.  But experts say that the Fed probably won't slash rates so soon, at least if the economy stays hot (all bets are off if the US defaults on its debt). A rate-hike pause could actually be better for stocks than a cut, they say. The Fed is unlikely to cut rates in July Experts say that the Fed won't cut rates anytime soon for two key reasons: Inflation remains sticky, and the economy has stayed strong. Although prices are stabilizing, inflation remains well above the Fed's 2% target. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose 4.2% for the 12 months ended in March. Meanwhile, American unemployment is at a record low. The US housing market is cooling, but low inventory and persistent demand is pushing home prices higher in some parts of the country.  In other words, there's nothing \u2014 at least, not yet \u2014 to convince the Fed it should pivot to lowering rates. \"The Fed rarely cuts rates without some sort of crisis in between,\" said Kara Murphy, chief investment officer at Kestra Investment Management. The Fed last slashed rates after an emergency meeting in March 2020, when the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic sent US markets tumbling into the first bear market in 11 years and incited panic that the global economy could tip into a deep recession. The collapses of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank this year spurred fears that the banking sector could face more turmoil and credit standards will tighten. But the turmoil has largely been contained to regional banks, and both financial and economic leaders have maintained that the banking sector remains stable. A serious turn for the worse in the banking sector, an implosion in the labor market or a similar nosedive for the economy would have to occur for the central bank to lower rates in July, says Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. \"The Fed would lose what credibility they have left if for no reason, they went from hiking to cutting,\" Sonders added. Would a July cut benefit stocks? Even if the Fed were to bring rates down soon, an immediate bull run isn't guaranteed. History shows that stocks tend to perform tepidly following a pivot to rate cuts compared to a pause: The S&P 500 has historically climbed 16.9% on average in the 12 months following the last hike of a Fed rate cycle and fallen 1% in the 12 months after the central bank first cut rates, Credit Suisse said in a May 9 note. \"Assuming that the May 3 rate increase was the last of this cycle, stocks should perform quite well through the remainder of the year. However, if the Fed were to ease in July \u2014 as the futures imply \u2014 the upside would be far more limited,\" the analysts said. Cutting rates prematurely could hold grave consequences for the economy.  Between 1972 and 1974, then-Fed Chair Arthur Burns hiked interest rates dramatically. Then, he cut them back down as the economy contracted.  When inflation later ripped higher, the Paul Volcker-led Fed took drastic action to push interest rates up to tame it. The effective Fed funds rates topped 22% by its peak in July 1981, and the central bank's aggressive tightening helped trigger back-to-back recessions that drove the unemployment rate as high as 10%. Powell acknowledged the missteps in a speech last August at Jackson Hole. The Fed has since signaled that it likely won't lower rates this year and reaffirmed its commitment to tamping down inflation. \"I don't think that the Fed is going to be in any hurry to cut rates this time,\" said Marco Pirondini, US head of equities at Amundi. that's not to say that a Fed rate cut this year is completely out of the cards, says Nicole Webb, senior vice president at Wealth Enhancement Group. The Fed eventually will want to lower rates back down, but it likely won't want to do it at the historical pace it's raised them over the past year, she says. \"They can slowly pace us down to 2.5% without the inflation monster rearing its ugly head again,\" Webb said. \"And I do actually believe it's possible.\"",

            "body": "Tanya Tilghman moved to the Bay Area as a teenager to live with her mom. Later, she married, had two sons and made a home in San Francisco's historically Italian North Beach district, up the hill from the tourist and financial centers.  Even when her marriage broke down, she never thought of leaving. This was her city, her people. Liberal like her, with a mix of income levels and a general sense of community. She didn't worry about her growing boys going out on the streets where she herself always felt safe.  But those streets have changed, she says. She believes policies from City Hall and even groups who advocate for the homeless have exacerbated some of the problems and the community she once felt a part of has gone, she says. And her son got caught up in a scene you can almost not avoid in the city: the drug scene. Roman Vardanega first tried illegal drugs at the start of high school, Tilghman said, taking a prescription medication at a friend's house.  He quickly became hooked, his mother said, moving on to cocaine, heroin and later fentanyl, all available in the city's seedy Tenderloin area. Tilghman admits she was uneducated about the prevalence of hard drugs, even na\u00efve. But it was not something she encountered every day. Back then \"I think it's a lot worse now than when I was growing up here,\" she said. \"We used to come to the Tenderloin when I was a teenager because we thought it was just kind of fun, edgy and I never as a teenager felt unsafe. But I also don't remember people coming up to me and asking me if I want to buy drugs.\"  One of her first clues that her son was getting in deep was when she was with him on a tour outside City Hall while he was in high school. It was a few blocks from the Tenderloin and some of the unhoused people on the street knew him by name, as if he spent a lot of time out there with them -- which is what he was doing, scoring his drugs.  She tried to help. Vardanega spent the 11th grade in rehab but persuaded his mom to let him return. She welcomed him home, but so did the streets.  By then, her neighborhood had changed, with drugs seemingly freely available, even just heading home on the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) local transport system.  \"When I got out of the BART station, the first thing that I was asked is if I wanted to buy drugs,\" Tilghman said. The ease of getting and using drugs made the city a dangerous and sometimes deadly playground for people like her son. Vardanega started to live on the streets full-time when the Covid pandemic hit in 2020. The city shut down, residents either left or stayed inside and at the height of the pandemic, more people died of drug overdoses than Covid-19. \"All the tents started going up in the city,\" Tilghman said. \"The open-air drug market became a lot worse. And so it became easier for him to buy drugs and to use it out in the open.\"  And confusingly to Tilghman, the city just seemed to look away. \"The city's policies have absolutely hurt my son, has hurt us, and has caused him to, I would say go into his addiction even a lot more,\" she said.  \"If you got busted with drugs, most likely you're not going to jail, the police officers would just let you go,\" she said. \"That made the situation a lot worse, especially for my son because he's really young, and still kind of in that party state of mind.\" Tilghman's state of mind was focused on one goal: finding her son. She knew he was an addict. She knew she loved him so much it hurt. And she knew she would not stop searching until she found him even if that meant putting herself in danger. She would walk the streets looking at things most people try to avoid, looking directly into the eyes of the people living on the streets. Sometimes she got back blank stares. Other times a sympathetic ear or a hopeful hint about where her son might be.  She didn't find him, but so many people were like him. \"What makes me sad is that I see my son's face in everybody's faces ... out on the streets,\" Tilghman said. As Covid descended, many housed residents began disappearing and the tent cities exploded onto the sidewalks, along with the drugs, the addictions and signs of mental illness.  Mayor London Breed declared a state of emergency in the city, to include a \"linkage center\" in the Tenderloin, promoted as a place where addicts could get services to help them.  When it opened in January 2022, Tilghman was hopeful it could be somewhere her son would find himself, and one day she went to take a look. When she got there, she heard music blaring and tried to get a look inside.  \"I saw people doing drugs. I couldn't believe it. I'm like, this is a place where people are supposed to get help. And they're actually doing drugs?\" Tilghman said. A little later, she posed as an addict and went to the center for a closer look.  \"I said to them that I wanted to get off drugs, and that I needed help,\" she said. \"And they laughed at me. And the guy at the door said, 'We can help you do drugs. But if you want help getting off drugs, you're gonna have to come back tomorrow',\" Tilghman said. The center had what was supposed to be an area where overdoses could be treated, but it became known as a place to take drugs, not seek other services. \"The most upsetting thing ... was that the harm reduction area was more like a party scene,\" Tilghman said. \"If my son were to go there wanting to access services, him being addicted to drugs, if he were to see a party scene with people dancing and singing and doing drugs, and most likely selling drugs inside, there's just no way he would access services. Because he would get so distracted, and be so triggered that he would go and use.\"  The city's laissez-faire philosophy had just gone too far, she felt.  \"When you could walk into a store and steal under $1,000 worth of merchandise and get away with it -- that's going way too far,\" she said. \"It's going too far when you could smoke crack in front of a police officer and the police officer just looks at you and doesn't even arrest you.\" The struggle to try to save her son wore her down. Not once, but three times Tilghman says she got so low and so hopeless she attempted suicide.  The situation is beginning to change, both for Tilghman personally, and perhaps her city.  The Tenderloin Linkage Center, which was later renamed to just the Tenderloin Center, closed last December. Tilghman has found new support and a mission working with Mothers Against Drug Addiction and Deaths. A new district attorney took over after the previous one was recalled by voters who perceived him as soft on crime. Tilghman's son Vardanega got in trouble with the law, served jail time and was sent to a court-mandated rehab program. Incarceration is a good thing for him in Tilghman's mind -- keeping him alive, off the streets and giving him a chance in a treatment program.  San Francisco is still beautiful to her -- with the Golden Gate Bridge, the Presidio and Fisherman's Wharf, the Italian enclave of North Beach. But it has become scarier, and she feels some of the blame has to go to politicians whose job it is to clean up the streets. \"I'm liberal,\" Tilghman said. \"My politics have stayed the same and things have gone crazy around me.\"",

            "body": "Amid pressing concerns that a surge of migrant crossings would be triggered by the expiration of the US border restriction policy known as Title 42, some southern border communities have reported receiving fewer-than-expected migrant arrivals since the policy has been lifted.   \"We continue to encounter high levels of non-citizens at the border but we did not see a substantial increase overnight or an influx (of migrants) at midnight\" after the policy expired Thursday night, Blas Nu\u00f1ez-Neto, Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary for border and immigration policy, said Friday morning.  Officials have warned that the lifting of Title 42 -- a controversial Trump-era policy from the start of the Covid-19 pandemic which allowed authorities to swiftly turn away migrants encountered at the US-Mexico border -- could invite a crush of migrants and aggravate the humanitarian crisis at the southern border. The policy's expiration is due to the declared end of the national public health emergency around Covid-19. Even before the lifting of Title 42, border community leaders have said they are overwhelmed by the flow of migrant arrivals and are struggling to meet their needs as social services are pushed to the brink.  In anticipation of the policy's expiration, federal and local authorities have been bracing for the anticipated influx, including at least two South Texas counties that issued preemptive disaster declarations. The Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense have also sent thousands of personnel to the border to support local authorities, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Wednesday.  Officials warn of potential for dangerous overcrowding Despite the relative calm on the border at the end of Title 42, US authorities are warning that migrant processing and detention facilities could become dangerously overcrowded in the aftermath of the pandemic-era immigration restriction.  The Biden administration was dealt a significant stumbling block when the state of Florida sued to halt a key part of its plan to manage the anticipated border crossings.  The plan, which was temporarily blocked by a federal judge in Florida on Thursday, would allow US Customs and Border Protection to release some apprehended migrants from its custody without court dates or, in some cases, release them with conditions.  In an emergency motion seeking a stay of the temporary restraining order, US immigration officials warned that without measures to conditionally release some migrants, there could be over 45,000 migrants in custody by the end of the month. \"Noncitizens held in overcrowded facilities are not only vulnerable to communicable diseases, but this vulnerability is likely to be compounded by some aspects of the noncitizens' journey including poor health and nutrition, lack of access to health care, and/or inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene services while migrating to the Southwest border,\" immigration officials said in the motion.  The US Border Patrol has encountered approximately 1.33 million migrants in fiscal year 2023 to date, according to the motion. The expiration of Title 42 is expected to lead to a further surge, with numbers projected to average 12,000 to 14,000 a day, a senior Customs and Border Protection official said in a declaration filed with the motion.  \"Over the last week, the ten day average encounters is 9,087, with May 8, 9, 10 and all surpassing 10,000 apprehensions with a daily in custody average of 23,646,\" said the official, Matthew J. Hudak, deputy chief of the US Border Patrol. \"On balance, daily encounters have been outpacing daily bookouts, that is a final release from a CBP holding facility, to include transfer to ICE custody, release, repatriation, or expulsion from the United States, by approximately 950 noncitizens over the last seven days,\" Hudak said.  The motion said surging migration coupled with the termination of Title 42 \"is overwhelming U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities, risking widespread health and safety risks to migrants, government employees, and the public.\" 'We still need to prepare for the unknown' Among the US cities that saw fewer-than-anticipated migrants on Friday was McAllen, Texas, which sits across the border from the Mexican city of Reynosa. \"It's not the numbers we initially expected, and we hope it keeps that way,\" said McAllen Mayor Javier Villalobos.  About 1,200 migrants are already staying in a shelter and processing facility set up by the city, the mayor said. Authorities hope to expand the site's capacity to 5,000 people in the coming days, he said.  In El Paso, which has seen hundreds of migrants sleeping on sidewalks after a recent spike in arrivals, Mayor Oscar Leeser said Friday that the city did not see the expected surge of migrants after Title 42 lapsed.  At the city's border gate around noon on Friday, the scene was mostly empty except for a few arriving migrants. Just the day before, about 1,000 migrants were waiting to be processed in the afternoon, including some who bore wounds and injuries from their treacherous crossing journeys. Leeser said El Paso has so far seen a \"smooth transition\" out of Title 42 but is still preparing for what the future may hold.  \"We know that we still need to prepare for the unknown because we don't know what's going to happen next week and continue to happen day in and day out,\" Lesser said.  Mexico Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said the number of migrants in the border city of Ciudad Juarez was about 10,000 people, with about 5,500 counted in Matamoros -- the same as earlier in the week. About 500 migrants gathered in Tijuana.  Migrant flows dropped in recent days, he said, describing the border situation as \"calm and normal.\"  In the absence of Title 42, US authorities will now revert to Title 8, a decades-old protocol for asylum seekers which could carry lengthier processing times and more severe consequences for those crossing unlawfully.  'Concern' about Florida lawsuit's impact President Joe Biden has faced scrutiny from both sides of the aisle over his administration's handling of the expiration of Title 42, and Biden has strained to prove he can control the crisis at the border and humanely deal with a possible influx of those seeking asylum.  Under the administration's plan to manage the anticipated border crossings, migrants would be released \"on parole\" on a case-by-case basis and be required to check in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Some may also be placed in detention program alternatives.  The Department of Homeland Security said the strategy would help relieve some of the strain on overcrowded border facilities.  District Judge T. Kent Wetherell in Florida, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, has blocked the administration's plan to release some migrants for two weeks. The judge said the Biden administration simply failed to prepare for Title 42's ending and that it was also not able to sufficiently justify why its policy was only unveiled on Wednesday, when the end of the policy has been anticipated for months.  The White House responded to the lawsuit on Friday, saying Florida Republicans intended to \"sabotage\" the administration's border control efforts.  \"That's what we've been seeing from Republican officials over and over again for the past several months,\" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters during Friday's press briefing. \"Instead of trying to deal with an issue or talking to the federal government on how to deal with an issue, maybe, in their state or in their city, they don't do that -- they actually sabotage what we're trying to do.\"  Customs and Border Protection will comply with the judge's order, the agency said early Friday, but called it a \"harmful ruling that will result in unsafe overcrowding at CBP facilities and undercut our ability to efficiently process and remove migrants, and risks creating dangerous conditions for border patrol agents and migrants.\" Nu\u00f1ez-Neto on Friday expressed \"concern\" about the Florida lawsuit's impact on \"our ability to process people quickly given the elevated encounter levels we are facing.\" Nu\u00f1ez-Neto also warned of the potential for \"unsafe overcrowding at CBP facilities\" and risk of \"dangerous conditions for Border Patrol agents as well as non-citizens in our custody.\"",

            "body": "Mother's Day is one of the busiest days for the American restaurant industry, presenting a massive operational challenge to restaurants. That's why it gained a reputation among waiters and restaurant staff as one of the most grueling days on the calendar. \"Every server knows that working on Mother's Day is hell. In fact, if I die and go to hell, I completely expect it to be Mother's Day. 365 days a year,\" wrote Darron Cardosa, in his book \"The Bitchy Waiter: I'm Really Good at Pretending to Care.\"  What's so bad about it? From big groups that show up in waves (\"most of us are here!\"), to food-fussy kids to splitting the check dramas and coffee-cup lingerers, restaurants hate this holiday. This year is expected to be particularly challenging as high inflation and rising menu prices give some restaurant-goers an extra sense of entitlement. \"The anticipation alone can make you anxious,\" said Joe Haley, an abstract artist who works as a server at a Quincy, Massachusetts, Italian-American restaurant. It gets \"jam-packed. People are calling at the last minute for a reservation, there are other people who made multiple reservations so Mom could have her pick and they never cancel... people who take out their mother once a year tell you 'Nothing can go wrong!'\" he said.  But it does. With big tables, a few late arrivals can kick a kitchen into chaos. \"And every family has at least one black sheep or in-law who can't be relied upon to save their lives. Mother's Day: I dread it,\" Haley added. Chefs, servers and owners said that this year guests have set their expectations high: Special occasion meals in a time of rising food prices. In a post-pandemic world, luxury -- or rather the appearance of luxury and excess -- is \"in.\" Across the country, customers will get aggravated if their $30 eggs Benedict isn't dolloped with caviar on Sunday. Tastes have changed, literally, since Covid, said Chef Art Smith, who has been personal chef to Oprah Winfrey and Jeb Bush. He will be serving hundreds of Mother's Day meals at his four restaurants including his Homecomin' at Disney Springs at Walt Disney World. The people who visit? \"They're drinking more. They want more carbs -- If it's mac and cheese, it has to be the cheesiest. But they want salads, and they want more veg sides, too. They just want more.\" A busy day for restaurants The National Retail Federation forecasts that Mother's Day spending will reach $35.7 billion this year, with a record $5.6 billion alone spent on a meal or outing, up 6% from last year. It's the second-busiest day in the restaurant business, eclipsed only by Valentine's Day, according to online reservations site OpenTable.  Mother's Day presents \"an operational challenge,\" said Shawn Walchef, owner of five Cali BBQ eateries in the San Diego area. \"It's the busiest day of the year and also the day guests have the highest expectations. He foresees some fuss over tables on the patio -- \"In Southern California, everyone wants to sit outside.\" For many restaurants, this is the first big holiday since 2019 that hasn't been overshadowed by the pandemic. \"It's a lot of people getting together who haven't seen each other in a while,\" said owner Binh Douglas, who opened Main Prospect in Southampton, New York, about 18 months ago. He expects that guests Sunday will be spending about 40% more than usual, and that a third of the adults will add the $19.95 \"bottomless mimosa\" to their meal. Fortunately, egg and seafood prices have come down in the last few weeks, he said. Rising prices But inflation has left its mark on Mother's Day brunch. At the Breakers in Palm Beach, Mother's day brunch in The Circle restaurant is $250 per person (up from $160 in 2019) with unlimited Champagne cocktails and a harpist who goes from table to table.  At the family-packed McLoone's Boathouse in West Orange, New Jersey, also home to a waterfront buffet, brunch has gone to $54.95 from $49.95 in 2019.  Pricing is touchy. \"Your Mother's Day meal can't be obnoxiously expensive,\" said Derek Axelrod, co-owner of Manhattan's Upper East Side T bar restaurant. Their Mother's Day menu will likely be upwards of $100 person, but won't turn much of a profit, he said. They're counting on liquor sales to do that. Meanwhile T bar is adding touches like a fois gras, cranberry and chicken parfait to the menu. Servers and owners are also under pressure to \"push the lobster.\" Seven different restaurants at the Venetian Resort in Las Vegas are serving Mother's Day meals that include lobster (The resort's round-up of all its Mother's Day menus notes that a subsequent gondola ride is an additional $39). Ophelia, a rooftop restaurant near the United Nations in New York, solves the \"luxury\" problem neatly by offering a menu in which Mom gets it all: fried quail egg, lobster, filet mignon, waffles and smoked salmon -- but be warned: it's a $59-per-person presentation of \"petite bites.\" In Naples, Florida, the hamburger at the Veranda E restaurant on Sunday will be brought under glass, and a cloud of smoke will rise up as it is uncovered. \"That's new for us,\" says owner Mary Brandt, who will have four generations of women from her family at the restaurant. To maximize profits and seating, chain restaurants are changing, too. Ruth's Chris Steak House, which has locations in about three-dozen states, is opening several for breakfast or brunch on Mother's Day; at the Fort Worth location, there will be wild blueberry pancakes. And some Red Lobsters are giving Moms a coupon for 10% off their next meal -- even including off the Ultimate Endless Shrimp Feast. So, book now, and tip your server. Of all holidays, Mother's Day is considered so stressful for workers that the National Restaurant Association recommends that owners ensure that their servers are \"fed and properly hydrated\" and should be given a \"combat-duty\" bonus -- especially the mothers on staff who work the shift.  Server Joe Haley, in Quincy, has a better idea: \"Why can't you people just make your Mom breakfast?\"",

            "body": "The Supreme Court holds more power than it used to and, thanks to its \"shadow docket,\" can make consequential decisions that affect every American without so much as a written decision. That's my takeaway from a fascinating and educational new book by Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas who is also a CNN contributor. I talked to Vladeck about \"The Shadow Docket: How the Supreme Court Uses Stealth Rulings to Amass Power and Undermine the Republic,\" which publishes on May 16. Excerpts of our conversation, conducted by phone, are below. What is the shadow docket? WOLF: Can you explain to people what you mean by \"shadow docket\"? VLADECK: The term is not mine. It was coined by University of Chicago law professor Will Baude in 2015.  Will meant it really as this umbrella term.  Not as a pejorative, but just as a description of the fact that the vast majority of rulings that the Supreme Court hands down that we don't pay attention to.  They're not the fancy decisions on the merits docket. They're not the cases where the court hears oral arguments and writes these lengthy rulings with concurrences and dissents.  The typical shadow docket ruling is an unsigned, unexplained order. And most of them are banal. But not all of them.  Will's insight, which I have rather shamelessly appropriated, is that there's a lot of really important stuff that happens through unsigned, unexplained orders. Just because they're unsigned and unexplained doesn't mean that we ought not to care about them, talk about them, study them and try to divine broader patterns from them. The shadow docket helped Republicans in the midterm election WOLF: You write about how the court, without explaining itself, either invalidated or influenced congressional maps in the last election in three states: Georgia, Alabama and Louisiana. Right now, Republicans have a four-seat majority in the House. Do you feel like those decisions determined the outcome of who was going to control the House?  VLADECK: I think it's close. We're talking about two decisions from the court in cases from Alabama and Louisiana, and then those decisions were directly followed in Georgia.  There's no question that, but for the court's interventions, at least three House seats in the current Congress would likely have been controlled by Democrats as opposed to Republicans.  What I think is really hard to say is what other effects might have followed. The New York Times has suggested that those decisions affected control of as many as seven to 10 House seats. That, I think, is a little more circumstantial.  There's no question that the decisions in the Alabama and Louisiana cases helped to give the Republicans the majority they currently have in the House. Whether they actually directly affected control, I think is a close call. Does the problematic behavior continue? WOLF: Justice Samuel Alito is unapologetic about use of the shadow docket. Chief Justice John Roberts and other conservatives dislike it. How have things changed in recent months? Has it been used more or less since you stopped writing this book? VLADECK: With regard to what I think is the problematic behavior on the shadow docket, I think we have seen less of that in the current term. And actually, I think we can see patterns of that go all the way down to October 2021, when Justice (Amy Coney) Barrett wrote this very, very cryptic concurrence in a case about the Covid vaccine mandate for Maine health care workers.  It was delphic in what it said, but signaled a bit of a break between Barrett and (Brett) Kavanaugh, who joined that opinion, and Justices (Clarence) Thomas, Alito and (Neil) Gorsuch in how often they were going to be willing to vote to intervene on the shadow docket and what kinds of cases they were willing to intervene in. Last week, the stay in the Oklahoma death penalty case, Richard Glossip, there were no dissents from that intervention. Even the mifepristone ruling in April, there are only two public dissents.  One of the really interesting stories here is the court really does seem to have moderated at least some of its behavior. Part of that, I think, is because to at least some degree, the median justices have become convinced that some of the court's prior behavior is problematic. How the extraordinary became ordinary WOLF: Do you have thoughts on motivations behind the rise of the shadow docket, which you pegged to the seating of Justice Barrett and this new conservative supermajority? Do you think that there was some concerted effort by the more conservative justices to exploit this?  VLADECK: I think the short answer is no. But I know that there are going to be folks who disagree.  The book tries to unpack some of this chronologically, because I think the story makes a lot of sense when told in sequence.  Starting in 2017, the court was confronted with an unprecedented flurry of emergency applications from the Trump administration. It reacted to those applications iteratively, one at a time, without actually stepping back and looking at the whole waterfront, so the court actually kept digging itself in deeper and deeper.  Had the justices actually taken a step back and asked whether this was a practice they wanted to condone, they might not have said yes. And I think with each new intervention, with each successive case, what had previously been extraordinary became ordinary.  Without there necessarily having been any deliberateness or malice, the conservative majority just routinized the types of interventions that had until 2017 been completely unroutine.  It's only when we get to the Covid cases in 2020 and 2021 that now it starts to look like some of this is willful, because it's only in those cases where we see the court deciding legal questions on the shadow docket through emergency applications that were in front of the justices already on the merits docket.  There was nothing stopping the court from using merits cases to reach these questions about religious liberty, and the court did it through the shadow docket anyway.  I really think it started as just an unstructured off-the-cuff reaction to unusually aggressive behavior by the Trump administration and then just sort of morphed into something else as time went on. A patchwork of rights in the US WOLF: You point to the Obergefell decision (legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide) to argue that the court had already spoken on same-sex marriage through years of inaction. There was a patchwork of marriage laws the court had tolerated for a number of years. Reading that made me think we're returning to that with abortion rights. And certainly with guns. The patchwork nature of rights in this country is growing not shrinking, despite the gay marriage decision.  VLADECK: I think it's grown in some respects and is shrinking and others. The more that the Supreme Court constitutionalizes things, the less of a patchwork we have.  If you look at the Second Amendment context, I think it's actually less of a patchwork, because more and more variances in how localities regulate guns are being struck down by the courts for violating the federal Constitution. Versus contests where the court is stepping away from constitutional enforcement, like abortion. It's more contextual than sort of categorical. The Supreme Court evolved to grab power from Congress. And Congress gave it away WOLF: I've done a lot of writing about the filibuster, which is this custom that has evolved to be a major part of the US government and slowed or stalled legislation in Congress. Your descriptions of how the court has evolved reminded me of that. You argue the justices have essentially grabbed power from Congress over the last 100 years or so to gain more control over their docket.  VLADECK: When we look at the court today, we see a court that controls virtually all of its docket, a court that decides not just which cases it's going to hear, but which issues it's going to decide within the cases it chooses to hear.  For most of us, we've never known anything different. And so we just assume that that's how the court is supposed to operate.  The reality is totally different. Until 1891, and really in practice until 1925, virtually all of the court's docket was mandatory -- the court had to decide any case over which it had jurisdiction.  That made it a lot harder for the justices to have an agenda. It made it a lot harder for the justices to target particular disputes and look around for cases. The rise of certiorari, of docket discretion, is actually a thoroughly untold but undeniable part of the story of why today's Supreme Court is so powerful, despite the founders' views that this would be the least dangerous branch.  The court today actually has a ton of power. Some of that story is about a power grab.  But a fair amount of the story is about acquiescence and abdication by Congress, which gave the court the certiorari power in the first instance; which never reined it in, even as the court has seemed to used it to claim more and more power; and which in 1988 took all the brakes off of certiorari and said, yep, just about all the court's docket is going to be discretionary -- and which has done absolutely nothing since then to exercise any modicum of control over the court's docket. That's why the story that the book tries to tell is not just a story about the court. It is a story about the separation of powers and how the shadow docket is in some respects just a symptom of the broader disease of separation of powers dysfunction that we're seeing right now. How to fix the court? Do something WOLF: You come back to that 1988 law repeatedly in the book. I wonder what you think Congress should do now to change the court. There are proposals to change the number of justices, to change the terms of justices. What would be your prescription? VLADECK: My prescription is sort of even sillier, which is I would just start by doing something. To me, the problem is that Congress has gotten completely out of the business of exercising any leverage over the courts, so much so that when Chief Justice Roberts was invited to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he responds and says that would raise the separation of powers concern.  No it wouldn't! Justices testify all the time. Or at least they did historically, and no one ever thought that was unconstitutional.  There are specific things Congress can do, but the real thing Congress needs to do is just more than nothing. Exercise more control over the court's docket. Use the budget, if necessary, as a cudgel.  If nationwide injunctions are a problem that's responsible for why the court is behaving in this way, make it easier for parties to appeal nationwide injunctions directly to the court without having to go through the emergency application process.  There are so many things Congress could do. The probl",

Thankfully, there's so much out there still to see and do. Here are 23 destination ideas from CNN Travel to get you started: Poland We could list new openings in Poland -- such as Hotel Verte, the new Autograph Collection property in Warsaw, which threw open its gilded doors (it's in a humongous Baroque palace) last August. But the reason you should visit Poland in 2023 isn't for the chance to stay in a place fit for royalty. It's to show solidarity with a country which has, in turn, shown solidarity to the people of Ukraine.  Sharing a 300-plus-mile border with a country under attack has meant that Poland has taken in more Ukrainian refugees than anywhere else. Add to that plummeting tourist numbers (though they're on the rise again), and you have a tricky situation.  So whether you fancy that Warsaw palace, a city break to the likes of Krakow, Gdansk, Wroc\u0142aw or Pozna\u0144 -- all hundreds of miles from the Ukrainian border -- or to get away from it all in the forests, lakes and mountains of the countryside -- now's your chance to do some good by taking a vacation. -- Julia Buckley Western Australia Back in April, thousands of people descended on the town of Exmouth and the greater Ningaloo Peninsula, to witness a rare total solar eclipse as it became visible over the northwestern edge of Australia.  Organizers spent more than a year planning for the event, which lasted about a minute, and featured musical performances, educational opportunities to learn about science and astronomy, and a three-day festival. But the state of Western Australia offers much more than some 60 seconds of wonder.  Spanning one-third of the entire continent of Australia, it stretches from the lively, growing state capital of Perth across deserts including the Great Victoria and Great Sandy to the wine country of Margaret River, the dramatic clifftops of the Kimberley and the quokka-covered Rottnest Island. -- Lilit Marcus  Liverpool, England England's port city of Liverpool, best known around the world as the birthplace of The Beatles, has added another chapter to its musical legacy.  It's the host city of Eurovision 2023, the spangly extravaganza of song that brings an influx of thousands of flag-waving fans from across the continent. The annual event is an opportunity for the city to bounce back after the ignominy of being stripped of its UNESCO World Heritage status in 2021.  In June, the city will celebrate 25 years of the Liverpool Biennial contemporary visual arts festival, as more than 30 international artists and collectives take over spaces in the city until September.  England is also marking the Year of the Coast in 2023, with food festivals and beach cleans taking place along the country's shores. Just a half hour from Liverpool city center by train, Crosby Beach is the permanent home of sculptor Antony Gormley's \"Another Place,\" where 100 cast-iron figures stand facing out to sea. -- Maureen O'Hare Charleston, South Carolina Charleston parades its past like no other US city, but it often glossed over the history of its Black residents. It's been taking steps to fix that. Enter the much-delayed International African American Museum, which is now expected to open in late June. Located on the shoreline of the Cooper River in the spot where many Africans first set foot in North America, it will explore the lives of slaves and their descendants. Visitors in late May and early June can enjoy the world-renowned Spoleto Festival featuring opera, theater, dance, musical acts and artist talks.  In March, foodies headed to the Charleston Wine and Food Festival to sample Lowcountry favorites. For fancy Southern fare, try Magnolias. Opened in 1990, it helped spur the city's culinary renaissance. For something informal, try Bertha's Kitchen in North Charleston, where red rice with sausage, fried chicken and lima beans rule. The eatery even caught attention of \"Roadfood\" author Michael Stern. -- Forrest Brown Vilnius, Lithuania   Self-effacing Vilnius admitted in an ad campaign this year that nobody really knows where it is. If their brilliant video didn't make you want to book a trip there immediately, perhaps this will: the capital of Lithuania celebrated its 700th anniversary on January 25, 2023.  To mark the milestone, a packed program of events, including music festivals and exhibitions, are being held throughout the year. But use the anniversary as a push to visit rather than following a program religiously.  The entire city center is a UNESCO World Heritage Site -- putting it up there with its fellow V-cities, Venice and Vienna. Vilnius makes it on the list thanks to its Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque buildings, all sitting on a medieval street plan, but it's best known for its Baroque architecture.  Don't miss the frothy bell tower of St. John's church (you can climb it for sweeping city views) or the church of St. Casimir, topped by a giant crown. Got an eye for social media? This is Europe's only capital city that allows hot air balloons to cruise over the city skyline. -- JB Fiji Brilliant blue waters, expansive coral reefs and hundreds of peaceful islands: Fiji is not a hard sell. But why go there in 2023? For one, the country only reopened post-Covid at the end of 2021, meaning that visitor numbers to the South Pacific paradise have yet to fully rebound.  While the country is spoiled for underwater beauty, take an opportunity to explore its above-ground treasures, too. The country's lone UNESCO World Heritage site is the town of Levuka, a former capital and an important port, which is studded with British colonial-era buildings amid coconut and mango trees.  To learn about the local Indigenous communities, travelers can take part in a kava welcoming ceremony -- named for the traditional drink at its center -- or enjoy a lovo, a meal cooked by hot coals in an underground pit covered with banana leaves.  Fiji Airways now has direct flights from Los Angeles and San Francisco, making it relatively easy to get to the islands. As the Fijians say, bula! -- LM Manaus, Brazil As the fate of the Amazon rainforest hangs in the balance, two eco-lodges around Manaus -- the capital of Brazil's Amazonas state, and gateway to the river -- have used their pandemic pause to get even more environmentally friendly. Juma Amazon Lodge, about 50 miles south of the city, is now fully powered by a new $400,000 solar plant, whose 268 double panels swagger nearly 40 feet into the air above the canopy (meaning no trees had to be cut). They've also built a biogas system to increase the efficiency of organic waste treatment, reducing annual carbon emissions by eight tons. Meanwhile, Anavilhanas Jungle Lodge, northwest of Manaus on the Rio Negro river, opened an off-grid \"advanced base\" during the pandemic that's 30 miles from the main lodge and accessible only via river.  Guests can take long jungle hikes through territory home to jaguars, pumas and giant armadillos in what's one of the Amazon region's most remote hotel facilities, then spend the afternoon in a hammock or by the pool. For 2023, the lodge is planning overnight stays in a creekside tent for small groups. Don't miss Manaus itself -- eating behemoth Amazonian fish outside the pink 1896 opera house is a bucket list experience. -- JB   Thessaloniki, Greece There's been no shortage of reasons to visit Greece's second city in recent times, with a UNESCO-endorsed local food scene that recently celebrated the refurb and reopening of its century-old Modiano food market. Throw in a popular waterfront and proximity to beautiful beaches and inland mountains, Thessaloniki is surely a contender for one of Europe's best city-break destinations.  What could make it even better? How about a gleaming new metro system? All being well, November 2023 should see the opening of the main line of an infrastructure megaproject that will eventually connect the city's downtown to its international airport. Driverless trains will whisk passengers through tunnels whose excavation has added to Thessaloniki's already rich catalog of archeological discoveries, many of which will be on display in specially created museum stations.  -- Barry Neild Rwanda January 2023 saw the official opening of Rwanda's most exciting hotel yet: Sextantio Rwanda, a collection of traditionally crafted huts on an island on Lake Kivu, one of Africa's largest lakes.  It's the first project outside Italy for Daniele Kihlgren, whose part-hotel, part-living history projects keep local tradition alive. A nonprofit delivering money straight to local communities, Sextantio sees guests fishing on the 1,000-square-mile lake, paddling in dug-out canoes, trying local banana beer and wildlife-spotting -- and not just the chickens, cows, pigs and goats that roam around the property.  Of course, you'll want to see gorillas. Adjoining Volcanoes National Park, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund opened the 4,500-square meter Ellen DeGeneres Campus in 2022. Its visitor center includes exhibits, virtual reality gorilla \"encounters\" and nature trails.  Over in Akagera National Park, white rhinos -- transferred from South Africa in 2021 to aid conservation -- are already calving. It's easier to get there, too. A new route from London joins Brussels, Dubai, Guangzhou and Mumbai as the only direct flights to Kigali from outside the African continent. -- JB Gothenburg, Sweden  Voted the world's most sustainable destination in the world for six years running, Sweden's second-biggest city is finally emerging from the shadow of Stockholm.  Once a major trading and shipping town, Gothenburg is now considered to be one of the greenest destinations in Europe, with 274 square meters (2,950 square feet) of green space per citizen, while 95% of its hotels are certified as eco-friendly.  Although Gothenburg officially turned 400 in 2021, the celebrations were put on ice because of the global pandemic. But they're finally taking place in 2023, so it's a great time to visit.  Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustav, who celebrates 50 years on the throne this year, will be in town on June 4, Gothenburg's official birthday, and the city's major anniversary festival is being held in the Frihamnen port district from June 2 to 5, with concerts and art events among the activities on offer.  The festivities will continue throughout the summer until",
