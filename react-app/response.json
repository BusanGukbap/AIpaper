As far as the eye can see, water stretches to the horizon \u2014 across roads, across crop fields, through homes and buildings.  Now, the massive snowpack that piled up on the Sierra Nevada this winter is a dripping time bomb. As it melts, the flood could triple in size by summer, threatening the surrounding communities and costing billions in losses.  \"All of the crops are completely flooded and ruined,\" resident Martina Sealy said as she held her baby daughter and gazed out across white-capped water, where vast fields of cotton and alfalfa had grown all her life. \"It takes a lot of jobs for people. That's a lot of food that we provide for up and down California and all around the nation. It's pretty scary.\" Even scarier when you realize the standing water that's there now is just the beginning of their ordeal.  \"This is just from the rain,\" Sealy said of the flooded fields. \"But when the snow melts, there's nowhere for it to go besides here.\" Tulare Lake was once the biggest freshwater body west of the Mississippi until farmers consumed so much of the Sierra Nevada runoff that it dried up and, over the decades, the lake bed became crop land.  Water was always a concern here, but mainly because there was never enough. As thirstier crops like almonds and pistachios came into vogue, relentless pumping of groundwater made Corcoran one of the fastest-sinking areas of the nation, just in time for Tulare Lake to come back from the dead with a vengeance.  \"The ground is literally sunk in some places by 10 or 15 feet over the past decade,\" said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California at Los Angeles. \"That has literally changed the topography of the historical lakebed. Some places are lower even than they were the last time there was a big flood event.\" Longtime residents, like Sidonio Palmerin, remember how the last great flood in 1983 took two years to dry out while the loss of agricultural work hollowed out Corcoran.  \"We lost half our school population and about one-third of our city population,\" he recalled. \"A lot of the people that were relocated lost their homes, their cars. It took a long time to recuperate.\"  Since there was no massive snowpack to worry about in '83 and the town was 10 feet higher, he's among the town's seniors who worry this time could be much worse.  \"There are people that are disabled, people that don't have transportation,\" Mary Gonzalez Gomez said, standing in front of the only home she's ever known. \"And they're so worried,  if we get flooded, where will we go? What will we do?\" As the water piled up, the city and local farming interests started using earth movers to raise the 14.5-mile levee that protects more than 20,000 residents and 8,000 inmates in two prisons.  \"God willing, that'll protect the city of Corcoran,\" said Sheriff David Robinson of King County.  But he knows they are racing against the melting snow.  \"We've been fortunate with a very slow, mild spring so far,\" he said. \"But we know the heat's coming.\" \"Our snowmelt this season will be like an ultra-marathon in duration,\" the National Weather Service in Reno said this week, \"and we are just getting started on the first mile.\" Last summer, UCLA's Swain published a paper that predicted more intense weather whiplash on a planet overheated by fossil fuel pollution, and in a worst-case scenario, relentless atmospheric rivers could not only make Tulare Lake permanent again \u2014 but could turn it into a vast, inland sea.  \"As disruptive and as damaging as this year's flooding has been, it's still nowhere near close to what we foresee is the plausible worst-case scenario,\" Swain said. \"We know that climate change is essentially putting the weather on steroids and giving us greater and greater chances of seeing these extremely heavy precipitation events and severe floods, even as we also see more severe droughts and that in the same part of the world.\" But for now, just the water that's already here is enough to throw lives like Martina Sealy's into uncertainty.  \"Tulare Lake is back,\" she said. \"And it may take over and put us out.\" ",

			"body": "There is always a crowd, but it can feel very lonely.  To get closer to freedom, they have risked it all.   Masked robbers and rapists. Exhaustion, snakebites, broken ankles. Murder and hunger.    Having to choose who to help and who to leave behind.  The trek across the Dari\u00e9n Gap, a stretch of remote, roadless, mountainous rainforest connecting South and Central America, is one of the most popular and perilous walks on earth.   Almost 250,000 people made the crossing in 2022, fueled by economic and humanitarian disasters -- nearly double the figures from the year before, and 20 times the annual average from 2010 to 2020. Early data for 2023 shows six times as many made the trek from January to March, 87,390 compared to 13,791 last year, a record, according to Panamanian authorities. They all share the same goal: to make it to the United States.   And they keep coming, no matter how much harder that dream becomes to realize.  A team of CNN journalists made the nearly 70-mile journey by foot in February, interviewing migrants, guides, locals and officials about why so many are taking the risk, braving unforgiving terrain, extortion and violence.  The route took five days, starting outside a Colombian seaside town, traversing through farming communities, ascending a steep mountain, cutting across muddy, dense rainforest and rivers before reaching a government-run camp in Panama.  Along the way, it became evident that the cartel overseeing the route is making millions off a highly organized smuggling business, pushing as many people as possible through what amounts to a hole in the fence for migrants moving north, the distant American dream their only lodestar. Day 1: Sendero Acand\u00ed Seco to La Ye camp At dusk, the arid, dusty camp on the banks of the Acand\u00ed Seco river near Acand\u00ed, Colombia, hums with expectation.   Hundreds of people are gathered in dozens of tiny disposable tents on a stretch of farmland controlled by a drug cartel, close to the Colombian border with Panama. The route ahead of them will be arduous and life-threatening. But many are na\u00efve to what lies ahead. They've been told that the days of trekking are few and easy, and they can pack light.       But money, not prayer, will decide who will survive the journey.  People are the new commodity for cartels, perhaps preferable to drugs. These human packages move themselves. Rivals do not try to steal them. Each migrant pays at least $400 for access to the jungle passage and absorbs all the risks themselves. According to CNN's calculations, the smuggling trade earns the cartel tens of millions of dollars annually.   The US, Panama and Colombia announced on April 11 that they will launch a 60-day campaign aimed at ending illegal migration through the Dari\u00e9n Gap, which they said \"leads to death and exploitation of vulnerable people for significant profit.\" In a joint statement, the countries added that they will also use \"new lawful and flexible pathways for tens of thousands of migrants and refugees as an alternative to irregular migration,\" but did not elaborate any further. A senior US State Department official declined to give a figure for cartel earnings. \"This is definitely big business, but it is a business that has no thought towards safety or suffering or well-being... just collecting the money and moving people,\" the official said.  This cash has made an already omnipotent cartel even more powerful. This seems to be a no-go area for the Colombian government. Their last visible presence was in Necocl\u00ed, a tiny beachfront town miles away, packed with migrants, overseen by a few police.    Migrants at the Acand\u00ed Seco camp are given pink wristbands -- like those handed out in a nightclub -- denoting their right to walk here. The level of organization is palpable and parading that sophistication may in fact be the reason the cartel has granted us permission to walk their route.    CNN has changed the names of the migrants interviewed for this report for their safety.  Manuel, 29, and his wife Tamara, finally decided to flee Venezuela with their children, after years scrabbling to secure food and other basic necessities. A socioeconomic crisis fueled by President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's authoritarian government, worsened by the global pandemic and US sanctions, has led one in four Venezuelans to flee the country since 2015.  \"It's thanks to our beautiful president ... the dictatorship -- why we're in this sh*t... We had been planning this for a while when we saw the news that the US was helping us -- the immigrants. So here we are now. Living the journey,\" Manuel said. But it was unclear what help he was referring to.   \"Trusting in God to leave,\" interrupted Tamara. \"It's all of us, or no one,\" added Manuel, on the decision to bring their two young children.   Their fate will be impacted by Washington's recent changes in immigration policy.   Last October, the US government blocked entry to Venezuelans arriving \"without authorization\" on its southern border, invoking a Trump-era pandemic restriction, known as Title 42. The Biden administration has since expanded Title 42, allowing migrants who might otherwise qualify for asylum to be swiftly expelled, turned back to Mexico or sent directly to their home countries. The measure is expected to expire in early May.   The government has said it will allow a small number to apply for legal entry, if they have an American sponsor -- 30,000 individuals per month from Venezuela, Nicaragua, Haiti and Cuba.  Like many others CNN interviewed, those policy changes had not impacted Manuel and Tamara's decision to go north.  As dawn drags people from their tents, the cartel's mechanics pick up. Christian pop songs are played to rally those at the start line, where cartel guides dispense advice. \"Please, patience is the virtue of the wise,\" says one organizer through a megaphone. \"The first ones will be the last. The last ones will be the first. That is why we shouldn't run. Racing brings fatigue.\"  But no one is paying attention. Everyone is jostling as though they're sprinters preparing to step into starting blocks. Small backpacks, one bottle of water, sneakers -- what is comfortable to move with now, won't suffice in the days of dense jungle ahead.  There is a call for attention, a pause, and then they are allowed to begin walking.  Sunlight reveals a crowd of over 800 this morning alone -- the same as the daily average for January and February, according to the United Nation's International Organization for Migration (IOM). These months in the dry season are normally the slowest on the route, because the rivers are too low to ferry migrants on boats, and the huge uptick is raising fears of more record-breaking numbers ahead.  The volume of children is staggering. Some are carried, others dragged by the hand. The 66-mile route through the Dari\u00e9n Gap is a minefield of lethal snakes, slimy rock, and erratic riverbeds, that challenges most adults, leaving many exhausted, dehydrated, sick, injured, or worse.  Yet the number of children is growing. A record 40,438 crossed last year, Panamanian migration data shows. UNICEF reported late last year that half of them were under five, and around 900 were unaccompanied. In January and February of this year, Panama recorded 9,683 minors crossing, a seven-fold increase compared to the same period in 2022. In March, the number hit 7,200. Jean-Pierre is carrying his son, Louvens, who was sick before he'd even started. Strapped to his father's chest, he's weak and coughing. But Jean-Pierre pushes on, their fee already paid. There is no going back. Their home of Haiti -- where gang violence, a failed government and the worst malnutrition crisis in decades make daily life untenable -- is behind them. And impossible choices lie ahead. Within minutes, the first obstacle is clear: water. The route, which crisscrosses the Acand\u00ed Seco, Tuquesa, Ca\u00f1as Blancas and Marraganti rivers, is constantly wet, muddy, and humid. Most migrants wear cheap rain boots and synthetic socks, in which their feet slowly curdle. They provide little ankle support and fill with water, leading some to cut holes in the rubber to let it drain out.  Physical distress is a business opportunity for the cartel. Once the riverbeds turn to an ascent up a mountain to the Panamanian border, porters offer their services. Each wear either the yellow or blue Colombian team's national soccer jersey with a number, to ease identification, and charge $20 to move a bag uphill -- or even for $100, a child.  \"Hey, my kings, my queens! Whoever feels tired, I'm here,\" one shouts.  The route they are walking is new, opened by the cartel just 12 days earlier. The main, older route, via a crossing called Las Tecas, had become littered with discarded clothes, tents, refuse and even corpses. The cartel, locals tell us, sought a more organized, less dangerous alternative -- more opportunities to earn more cash.  At one of several huts where locals sell cold soda or clean water with cartel permission at a mark-up, is Wilson. Aged about five, he has been separated from his parents. They gave him to a porter to carry, who raced ahead.  Wilson shakes his head emphatically when asked if he is going to the US. \"To Miami,\" he says. \"Dad is going to build a swimming pool.\" Asked about his future there, he says: \"I want to be a fireman. And my sister has chosen to be a nurse.\" He calls back down the trail: \"Papa, Papa!\" His father is nowhere to be seen.  In the background is the constant advice of the cartel guides. \"Gentlemen take your time,\" says one named Jose. \"We won't get to the border today. We have two hours of climbing left.\" He urges them to make use of the stream nearby, already crowded with people. \"Fill up your water. One bottle of water up there costs you five dollars,\" he says pointing up the hill. \"I know that a lot of you don't have the money to buy that, so better to take your water here.\"  The terrain is unforgiving, and the steep climb is particularly punishing on Jean-Pierre and his sick son Louvens, for whom breathing is audibly hard work. Other migrants offer suggestions: \"Perhaps he is overheating in his thick wool hat. Maybe he needs more water?\" His father struggles to move even himself uphill. Six hundred meters up the slope, bright light pierces the jungle canopy. Wooden platforms cover the clearing floor, and the buzz of chainsaws blends with music better suited to a festival. Drinks, shoes, and food are on sale. The route is so new, the cartel is cutting space for its clients into the forest as fast as they can arrive. Tents are pitched on fallen branches. Gatorades are cheerfully sold for $4. \"Keep a lookout for the snake,\" one machete-wielding guide warns. Dusk is a clatter of late arrivals, new tents being pitched, and attempts to sleep. The next day, and those after it, will be arduous. Day 2: La Ye to Pata de la Loma ",

			"body": "SpaceX has cleared the final regulatory hurdle standing before the inaugural launch of its Starship rocket \u2014 the most powerful rocket ever constructed. The Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches, announced Friday that it granted the company's request for an uncrewed flight test of the rocket out of the SpaceX facilities in South Texas. The vehicle, which has already undergone preflight ground testing, is poised to take off as soon as Monday. \"After a comprehensive license evaluation process, the FAA determined SpaceX met all safety, environmental, policy, payload, airspace integration and financial responsibility requirements,\" the agency said in a statement. Earlier Friday, the FAA issued an air traffic restriction for the area surrounding the launch. The Notice to Air Missions, or NOTAM, orders planes and other air traffic to steer clear of the launch area \u2014 which lies due East of Brownsville, Texas \u2014 on Monday between 7 a.m. and 10:05 a.m. CT (8 a.m. and 11:05 a.m. ET). This will be SpaceX's first attempt to put Starship into orbit, building on a yearslong testing campaign to work out the design of the rocket. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has talked about Starship for about a decade, making elaborate presentations about its design and describing it as the vehicle that underpins SpaceX's founding purpose: sending humans to Mars for the first time.  Additionally, NASA has already awarded SpaceX contracts and options \u2014 worth more than $3 billion \u2014 to use Starship to ferry government astronauts to the surface of the moon under the space agency's Artemis program. The inaugural flight test will not complete a full orbit around Earth. If successful, however, it will reach orbital speeds and travel about 150 miles above Earth's surface, well into altitudes deemed to be outer space.  Starship consists of two parts: the Super Heavy booster, a gargantuan rocket that houses 33 engines, and the Starship spacecraft, which sits atop the booster during launch and is designed to break away after the booster expends its fuel to finish the mission.  On this flight, the rocket booster will be discarded into the ocean shortly after liftoff. In future flights, however, SpaceX plans to recover the vehicle by guiding it to an upright landing back at the launch site. The Starship spacecraft will complete nearly one full lap of the planet, ending its flight with a splashdown off Hawaii.  Getting here Development of Starship has been based at SpaceX's privately held spaceport about 40 minutes outside Brownsville, Texas, on the US-Mexico border. Testing began years ago with brief \"hop tests\" of early spacecraft prototypes. The company began with brief flights that lifted a few dozen feet off the ground before evolving to high-altitude flights, most of which resulted in dramatic explosions as the company attempted to land them upright.  One suborbital flight test in May 2021, however, ended in success. Since then, SpaceX has also been working to get its Super Heavy booster prepared for flight. The massive, 230-foot-tall (69-meter-tall) cylinder is packed with 33 of the company's Raptor engines.  Fully stacked, Starship and Super Heavy stand about 400 feet (120 meters) tall. SpaceX has been waiting more than a year to get FAA approval for an orbital launch attempt. The company, and federal regulators tasked with certifying SpaceX launches won't pose risks to people or property in the area surrounding the launch site, have faced significant pushback from the local community, including from environmental groups. In June, the FAA granted SpaceX one key approval for launching Starship, though it laid out a list of \"mitigating actions\" the company would need to take before the first launch. During a call with reporters this week, an FAA official, who declined to be named for publication, said that the agency has been overseeing SpaceX's compliance with the mitigating actions, some of which are still in the works, even as the launch license is issued. The FAA official said government personnel will be on the ground to ensure SpaceX complies with its license during the test launch.",

			"body": "The first photo ever taken of a black hole looks a little sharper now.  Originally released in 2019, the unprecedented historic image of the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy Messier 87 captured an essentially invisible celestial object using direct imaging.  The image presented the first direct visual evidence that black holes exist, showcasing a central dark region encapsulated by a ring of light that looks brighter on one side. Astronomers nicknamed the object the \"fuzzy, orange donut.\" Now, scientists have used machine learning to give the image a cleaner upgrade that looks more like a \"skinny\" doughnut, researchers said. The central region is darker and larger, surrounded by a bright ring as hot gas falls into the black hole in the new image.  In 2017, astronomers set out to observe the invisible heart of the massive galaxy Messier 87, or M87, near the Virgo galaxy cluster 55 million light-years from Earth.  The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration, called EHT, is a global network of telescopes that captured the first photograph of a black hole. More than 200 researchers worked on the project for more than a decade. The project was named for the event horizon, the proposed boundary around a black hole that represents the point of no return where no light or radiation can escape. To capture an image of the black hole, scientists combined the power of seven radio telescopes around the world using Very-Long-Baseline-Interferometry, according to the European Southern Observatory, which is part of the EHT. This array effectively created a virtual telescope around the same size as Earth. 'Maximum resolution' achieved Data from the original 2017 observation was combined with a machine learning technique to capture the full resolution of what the telescopes saw for the first time. The new, more detailed image, along with a study, was released on Thursday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. \"With our new machine learning technique, PRIMO, we were able to achieve the maximum resolution of the current array,\" said lead study author Lia Medeiros, astrophysics postdoctoral fellow in the School of Natural Sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, in a statement. \"Since we cannot study black holes up-close, the detail of an image plays a critical role in our ability to understand its behavior. The width of the ring in the image is now smaller by about a factor of two, which will be a powerful constraint for our theoretical models and tests of gravity.\" Medeiros and other EHT members developed Principal-component Interferometric Modeling, or PRIMO. The algorithm relies on dictionary learning in which computers create rules based on large amounts of material. If a computer is given a series of images of different bananas, combined with some training, it might be able to tell if an unknown image does or doesn't contain a banana.  Computers using PRIMO analyzed more than 30,000 high-resolution simulated images of black holes to pick out common structural details. This allowed the machine learning essentially to fill in the gaps of the original image.  \"PRIMO is a new approach to the difficult task of constructing images from EHT observations,\" said Tod Lauer, an astronomer at the National Science Foundation's National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory, or NOIRLab. \"It provides a way to compensate for the missing information about the object being observed, which is required to generate the image that would have been seen using a single gigantic radio telescope the size of the Earth.\" Advancing research of black holes Black holes are made up of huge amounts of matter squeezed into a small area, according to NASA, creating a massive gravitational field that draws in everything around it, including light. These powerful celestial phenomena also have a way of superheating the material around them and warping space-time.  Material accumulates around black holes, is heated to billions of degrees and reaches nearly the speed of light. Light bends around the gravity of the black hole, which creates the photon ring seen in the image. The black hole's shadow is represented by the dark central region. The visual confirmation of black holes also acts as confirmation of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. In the theory, Einstein predicted that dense, compact regions of space would have such intense gravity that nothing could escape them. But if heated materials in the form of plasma surround the black hole and emit light, the event horizon could be visible. The new image can help scientists make more accurate measurements of the black hole's mass. Researchers can also apply PRIMO to other EHT observations, including those of the black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy.  \"The 2019 image was just the beginning,\" Medeiros said. \"If a picture is worth a thousand words, the data underlying that image have many more stories to tell. PRIMO will continue to be a critical tool in extracting such insights.\"",

			"body": "When the war in Ukraine finally comes to an end, the besieged city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine will go down as one of the most recognizable symbols of the conflict.    A place where happiness was brutally replaced with blood-drenched killing fields.   It will also be recorded in history as a battle that exposed more than anywhere the meat-grinder approach of Russian fighting. Where sending wave upon wave of fighters -- including former convicts recruited by the Wagner mercenary group and Russian elite forces -- became a military tactic to dislodge Ukrainian forces from the city.  For a prize of highly-questionable military value, the Kremlin, not known for valuing human life -- even that of its own citizens -- established a new threshold that tolerated the loss of several of its own combatants to every Ukrainian. \"The Russians at the moment, despite trying for six months, with huge numbers of personnel and huge numbers of losses, have been unable to take the town and at the moment have made very, very slow progress,\" Western officials said in a briefing last week.  Various experts and entities have debated the military significance of capturing Bakhmut -- a city with a pre-war population of around 70,000 -- with most agreeing a win or loss there would not alter the trajectory of the war. These days, those remaining are thought to number fewer than 4,000, including 38 children.  Instead, for the Russian side, capturing the city would bring limited military value but likely significant propaganda value for internal consumption -- especially for Russian war hawks and bloggers who have been critical of the Kremlin's war effort in Ukraine.  Taking Bakhmut would be the first Russian gain since it captured (and later lost) the key southern Ukrainian city of Kherson in November. It would also bring a boost to Wagner, which is said in leaked documents to have 22,000 troops in and around Bakhmut, possibly outnumbering the Ukrainian contingent there.  But even so, if NATO estimates of Russian losses of five soldiers to every Ukrainian is to be believed, the cost is significant. That Ukrainian forces have demonstrated such endurance in the battle for Bakhmut should come as little surprise. In the first phase of the war in 2014 -- and not far from Bakhmut itself -- Ukrainian \"cyborg\" troops held off heavily-armed Russian backed thugs at Donetsk International Airport for an astonishing 242 days. Like the current battle for Bakhmut, it too became emblematic of Ukraine's tenaciousness to defend itself against Russia's aggression -- particularly considering the Ukrainian Armed Forces were far less prepared and equipped. (In January 2021, citing the so-called cyborgs' \"stability, fearlessness and steadfastness,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the battle for the airport among the fiercest in that phase of the war).   A city of flower-lined river banks and swans In the Ukrainian public imagination, the average town and village evokes a romantic image of impeccably-maintained gardens hemmed in by sunflowers and tree-shaded parks. It is a place of plentiful cultural and religious symbols, such as gold-domed churches, art galleries and museums.  An image used to bring solace, especially during times of displacement. Bakhmut was no different: Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine's Office of the President, said journalists, historians and local artists have long called it \"one of the most picturesque cities in eastern Ukraine.\" For some Ukrainians, Bakhmut's reputation as a fortress extends back centuries when the area was fought over by pro- and anti-Moscow forces.  In more recent decades, during a typical summer, the banks of the Bakhmutka River were lined with flower gardens, parklands, water fountains, ducks and swans. A sign at the entrance to the city welcomed visitors with the slogan: \"Bakhmut: A City Open for Good.\" Elsewhere, the New York Street Pizza once offered a \"designer interior\" -- but pizza pies of questionable taste.  Previous to the war, the city -- formally known as Artemivsk until 2016 -- was a thriving metropolis and center of learning. It had an industrial base of salt and gypsum mining, and attracted tourists with its natural beauty and historic architecture. At its peak, local sparkling wine producer ArtWine was producing some 25 million bottles a year of bubbly in caves with a unique micro-climate. It even managed to find new suppliers for grapes after Crimea, which supplied 70% of grapes used in its annual production, was illegally annexed by Russia.   Scorched earth tactics But the scale of the bombardment of Bakhmut over the past ten months will most likely make the city largely uninhabitable. \"It wouldn't resemble what it might have been a year ago. Bakhmut is completely destroyed as a town, unlivable by any normal standards,\" western officials said in a briefing last week.  \"The enemy switched to so-called scorched earth tactics from Syria. It is destroying buildings and positions with airstrikes and artillery fire,\" Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukraine's ground forces, said of Bakhmut. History, as we've seen so many times during this war, has a way of repeating. \"Over the centuries the Soviets had done lots of damage in Bakhmut to wipe the Ukrainian spirit,\" Yevhen Hlibovytsky, former political journalist and founder of the Kyiv-based think tank and consultancy, pro.mova, told me. The gravity of Russian inhumanity in places such as Bucha and Bakhmut defy comprehension. In Bucha, Russian soldiers left hundreds of civilians dead in the streets and in mass graves.  War correspondent Janine di Giovanni, who has reported on conflicts ranging from Syria to Rwanda, wrote in a recent Vanity Fair article that the Russian atrocities she witnessed in Bucha, surpassed anything she had seen previously. Describing a young male victim, she reported: \"eyes were gouged out, his teeth were knocked clean from his jaw. A metal skewer inserted through his right eye had pushed through to the other side of his left ear.\" Just last week, fresh reports emerged of Russian illegal logging on an \"uncontrolled, barbaric\" industrial-scale that will \"inevitably lead to catastrophic consequences for the environment,\" according to Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar. Little wonder then, as the full-scale invasion passes the 400-day mark, that many Ukrainians believe their country -- home to seven UNESCO World Heritage sites -- is being systematically destroyed by Russian forces.   Where do we go from here? No Ukrainian, whether inside or outside their homeland (at least the many that I have met), wishes for the war to be prolonged for a day longer. At the same time, with Russian forces literally raping and pillaging their way through Ukraine, the willingness to accept territorial concessions is zero. The Ukrainian soul is bleeding like never before, but the desire to fight against Russian aggression is even stronger. Amid leaked reports that the Ukrainian side is short of ammunition and weaponry -- and taking heavy losses -- now is the time for the West to up its game even further and provide the Ukrainian Armed Forces with the muscle it needs to push the Russians back to pre-2014 lines. It's almost impossible to predict how the war will end. Even if the Kremlin agrees to a peace deal, they have a well-deserved track record for breaking international accords. Western leaders will need to employ courage and imagination to nudge Russian President Vladimir Putin.  As for Zelensky, with repeated polling over the last few months showing almost 90% of Ukrainians opposed to territorial concessions, if peace meant giving up even an inch of Ukrainian soil, he would need to be prepared to become politically unpopular to end a war that is defying resolution. Ukrainian historian Volodymyr Masliychuk, from the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, told me via email that salt, which is in plentiful supply in the area around Bakhmut, has sparked many conflicts over the centuries.  Once again, it seems, the riches of Bakhmut are being fought over.  \"The battle for Bakhmut in winter-spring 2023 will surely enter the history books as the bloodiest battle in Europe since World War II,\" said Masliychuk.  But what will remain once the guns go silent? When will Bakhmut's flowers ever bloom again?",

			"body": "The Ingenuity helicopter just achieved a huge milestone on Mars. The little chopper successfully completed its record-breaking 50th flight on Thursday, a few days shy of the second anniversary of its first aerial journey.  Ingenuity flew for the first time on Mars on April 19, 2021, reaching a height of 10 feet (3 meters) and hovering for about half a minute before touching back down. That 39-second trip marked the first powered, controlled flight of a rotorcraft on another planet. Since then, Ingenuity has surpassed all expectations, transitioning from a technology demonstration designed for five flights to an aerial scout for the Perseverance rover as it explores an ancient lake and river delta on Mars.  During its 50th flight, Ingenuity traveled over 1,057 feet (322.2 meters) in 145.7 seconds and achieved a new altitude record of 59 feet (18 meters). The chopper touched down near the 0.5-mile-wide (800-meter-wide) Belva Crater. \"Just as the Wright brothers continued their experiments well after that momentous day at Kitty Hawk in 1903, the Ingenuity team continues to pursue and learn from the flight operations of the first aircraft on another world,\" said Lori Glaze, director of the NASA Planetary Science Division, in a statement. Since arriving on Mars with the Perseverance rover in February 2021, Ingenuity has flown for more than 89 minutes and 7.1 miles (11.6 kilometers). That's no mean feat considering that much of the 4-pound (1.8-kilogram) chopper was built using off-the-shelf smartphone processors and cameras. \"When we first flew, we thought we would be incredibly lucky to eke out five flights,\" said Teddy Tzanetos, Ingenuity team lead at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in a statement. \"We have exceeded our expected cumulative flight time since our technology demonstration wrapped by 1,250% and expected distance flown by 2,214%.\" A risky journey The journey hasn't been easy, but Ingenuity has \"proven very robust so far,\" Tzanetos told CNN. The rotorcraft has faced numerous challenges since it first detached from the belly of the Perseverance rover more than two years ago.  The dangerous chill of Martian winter and its solar panel-blocking dust storms have passed, but the chopper's power supply still drops at night.  Each morning, the Helicopter Base Station on the Perseverance rover searches for Ingenuity's signal around the time the chopper is expected to \"wake up,\" waiting for a sign that its aerial scout is still functioning.  But Ingenuity's solar panels, batteries and rotor system are healthy. The chopper is \"still doing fantastic,\" Tzanetos said. \"We're looking forward to just keep pushing that envelope.\" Since the helicopter left the flat floor of Jezero Crater and headed to the river delta in January, its flights have only grown more challenging. Ingenuity has flown over uncharted and rugged terrain with landing spots surrounded by potential hazards.  \"We are not in Martian Kansas anymore,\" said Josh Anderson, Ingenuity operations lead at JPL, in a statement.  \"We're flying over the dried-up remnants of an ancient river that is filled with sand dunes, boulders, and rocks, and surrounded by hills that could have us for lunch. And while we recently upgraded the navigation software onboard to help determine safe airfields, every flight is still a white-knuckler.\" Ingenuity's team is already planning its next set of flights because the chopper has to remain at the right distance to stay in touch with the fast-moving rover, which can drive for hundreds of meters in a single day.  \"Ingenuity relies on Perseverance to act as a communications relay between it and mission controllers here at JPL,\" Anderson said. \"If the rover gets too far ahead or disappears behind a hill, we could lose communications. The rover team has a job to do and a schedule to keep. So it's imperative Ingenuity keeps up and is in the lead whenever possible.\" Looking ahead The Perseverance rover is moving on from an area that could contain hydrated silica, which might have information about a warmer, wetter Martian past and any potential signs of life from billions of years ago. Up next is Mount Julian, a site that will provide the rover with a panoramic view into Belva Crater. Ingenuity's journey has demonstrated how useful aircraft can be on space missions, scouting places that rovers can't go or helping plot a safe path to the next destination. The little chopper's data has also provided engineers with a treasure trove as they work on future Mars helicopters, including two that could play a role in helping return samples collected by Perseverance to Earth. The helicopter team continues to monitor Ingenuity's health closely as some of its components begin to show signs of wear and tear.  \"We have come so far, and we want to go farther,\" Tzanetos said. \"But we have known since the very beginning our time at Mars was limited, and every operational day is a blessing. Whether Ingenuity's mission ends tomorrow, next week, or months from now is something no one can predict at present. What I can predict is that when it does, we'll have one heck of a party.\"",

			"body": "Meteorite hunters, get ready to head into the woods.  A museum in Maine is offering $25,000 for the remains of a space rock that streaked across the sky last week before landing near the border between the United States and Canada. The fireball, which was visible in broad daylight and created a sonic boom, was detected by radar, allowing NASA's Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science (ARES) Lab to calculate the \"strewn field\" \u2014 where fragments of the meteor might be found \u2014 near Calais, Maine.  Darryl Pitt, head of the meteorite division at the Maine Mineral & Gem Museum, said he was keen to study any fragments of the meteorite, which, depending on the type, could contain valuable information about the origins of the solar system. The $25,000 reward is for the first meteorite piece found that weighs 2.2 pounds (1 kilogram) or more. However, he said the museum would be willing to pay for any specimen \"irrespective of its size.\"  \"Finding meteorites in woods of Maine. It's not the simplest of the environments,\" Pitt said. \"It's a sparsely populated area but not as sparsely populated as where most meteorites fall \u2014 the ocean,\" he added.   Worldwide, only eight to 10 meteorites are recovered each year out of hundreds of fireballs seen falling to Earth, Pitt said.  A meteorite that fell on a driveway in the United Kingdom in 2021 turned out to be an extremely rare type of space rock and is now part of the Natural History Museum in London. A 'significant event' The Maine meteorite was visible for more than four minutes from around 11.57 a.m. ET on Saturday, April 8, according to NASA. Winds might have carried smaller meteorites across the border into Canada, the agency noted.  \"For the light (of the fireball) to overwhelm the brightness of the day, it was a significant event,\" Pitt said.  Pitt said a meteorite would look different from the surrounding rocks. The outside would likely be blackened \u2014 after being toasted by the heat as it plummeted through Earth's atmosphere \u2014 while the inside would likely be a different color. It may also contain iron and therefore be attracted to a magnet.  The museum offered a reward for a meteorite once before. However, the search for fragments of a meteor that lit up the sky in the region in 2016 wasn't fruitful, Pitt said.  This time, Pitt said he was \"guardedly optimistic\" because there is more detailed information available from radar data, and he expects a \"robust response\" from meteorite hunters.",

			"body": "The European Space Agency has sent a spacecraft to explore Jupiter and three of its largest and most intriguing moons. The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer mission, or Juice, launched Friday at 8:14 a.m. ET aboard an Ariane 5 rocket from Europe's spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. The spacecraft separated from the Ariane 5 rocket 28 minutes after launch, and ESA received a signal from Juice about an hour after liftoff, confirming that Earth-based mission control is able to \"talk\" to the vehicle. \"We have #AcquisitionOfSignal from #ESAJuice! The spacecraft has said its first words from its new home in space, captured by our New Norcia ground station in Western Australia. @ESA_Juice, we hear you loud and clear,\" read a post from ESA operations' Twitter account. Over the course of the next 17 days, Juice will deploy its solar arrays, antennas and other instruments, followed by three months of testing and preparing the instruments. Juice will take eight years to reach Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system. During its lengthy cruise, the spacecraft will utilize some gravitational slingshots as it flies by Earth, our moon and Venus to help with the journey. INTERACTIVE: The search for life in our solar system Once Juice arrives at Jupiter in July 2031, the spacecraft will spend about three and a half years orbiting the gas giant and conducting flybys of three of its moons: Ganymede, Callisto and Europa. Toward the end of the mission, Juice will focus solely on orbiting Ganymede, making it the first spacecraft ever to orbit a moon in the outer solar system. Ganymede, Callisto and Europa are ice-covered worlds that may contain subsurface oceans that are potentially habitable for life. Meanwhile, NASA's Europa Clipper mission, launching in 2024, is expected to reach Jupiter in April 2030 and conduct nearly 50 flybys of Europa, eventually reaching just 16 miles (25 kilometers) above the moon's surface. Together, the two missions could unlock some of the biggest mysteries about Jupiter and its moons. Up close with the king of the solar system Exploration of Jupiter began with NASA's Pioneer and Voyager missions in the 1970s, followed by dedicated Jupiter missions like Galileo and the Juno probe. Juno has been orbiting Jupiter and flying by some of its moons since 2016.  The Juice mission has five main objectives, including using its powerful suite of 10 instruments to characterize the three icy moons and determine whether they harbor oceans, uncover what makes Ganymede so unique and determine if the moons are potentially habitable for life.  Planetary scientists want to know how deep the oceans are, if they contain salty or fresh water and how that water interacts with the ice shell of each moon. Ganymede, Callisto and Europa also have different surfaces. Juice could reveal what kind of activity has caused some of them to look dark and cratered or paler and grooved. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system, larger than Pluto and Mercury, and it's the only one that has a magnetic field similar to Earth. Juice's instruments can reveal the moon's rotation, gravity, shape, interior structure and composition and peer through its icy crust using radar. Juice will also conduct a detailed analysis of Jupiter to determine how the complex magnetic and radiation environment around this massive planet shaped its moons, as well as how Jupiter formed in the first place. Understanding more of Jupiter's origin story can help scientists apply those findings to Jupiter-like planets found outside of our solar system.  Jupiter's magnetic field is 20 times stronger than Earth's and it has a harsh radiation environment, both of which impact its moons. The Juice mission was designed to unravel what takes place as Jupiter interacts with its moons, including auroras, hot spots, radio emissions and waves of charged particles. The potential for life Although the three moons are encased in thick ice shells, interior heating could be taking place at each moon's core \u2014 and that warmth could make the interior oceans possible habitats for past or existing life. Juice can search the moons for evidence of the building blocks of life, including elements like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, iron and magnesium. Previous missions like Galileo and Cassini, which visited Saturn and its moons, confirmed that liquid water can be found on planets and moons far away from the sun \u2014 and that water is likely to exist under the surface.  \"I think Juice is a confirmation that our understanding of where to search for potential habitability has changed in the last 20 years,\" said Michele Dougherty, Royal Society research professor at Imperial College London and principal investigator of Juice's magnetometer.  Life as we understand it on Earth requires liquid water, a heat source and organic material \u2014 \"and then you need those first three ingredients to be stable enough over a long enough period of time that something can actually happen,\" Dougherty said.  \"With Juice, we want to confirm there's liquid water in these moons, confirm their heat sources. Other instruments will be able to remotely sense whether there's organic material on the surface as well.  And so it's putting all of those ingredients together,\" she said.  Surviving Jupiter Juice's truck-size spacecraft has been designed to survive a long journey to Jupiter \u2014 and it has to survive the extremes of the gas giant's environment once it arrives. Two cross-shaped solar arrays will provide the spacecraft with power and lead-lined vaults protect its most sensitive electronics. The ESA-led mission includes contributions from NASA and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency. Testing and modeling of Jupiter's radiation belts allowed engineers to prepare for what Juice will encounter. \"A key achievement of this model for us was to show that what at first seemed to be a dangerous place was not completely out of reach,\" said Christian Erd, Juice spacecraft and system manager, in a statement. \"Around three and a half years at Jupiter will involve the equivalent radiation exposure of a telecommunications satellite in geostationary Earth orbit for 20 years \u2014 which we have plenty of experience in managing.\"  In order to help Juice survive, its trajectory was designed to fly past Callisto 21 times but only swing by Europa twice. Europa is the closest to Jupiter and sits well within its radiation halo. Just two orbits of the moon will cause the spacecraft to experience a third of its overall radiation exposure. Some of Juice's instruments are shielded, while others will be exposed to the elements to probe the atmospheres of Jupiter and its moons. Multiple imagers and sensors will capture and send back data across different wavelengths of light. Given the eventual distance between the spacecraft and Earth, it will take 45 minutes to send a one-way signal to Juice. But that's nothing compared to the years-long wait for Juice to arrive at Jupiter.  Scientists are already anticipating the unique data Juice will return. \"I think the most critical time is the first flyby we have of Ganymede,\" Dougherty said. \"The first one or two flybys is when we are going to confirm the existence of an ocean.\"",

			"body": "Iran executed at least 582 people last year, a 75% increase on the previous year, according to human rights groups who say the rise reflects an effort by Tehran to \"instill fear\" among anti-regime protesters. It was the highest number of executions in the Islamic republic since 2015, according to a report released Thursday by the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) and the France-based Together Against the Death Penalty (ECPM) groups. The vast majority of the executions -- at least 544 -- were of people accused of murder and drug-related offenses, said the report. It added that almost 90% of the executions it recorded were not announced by Iranian authorities and some had been carried out in secret. The two rights groups said the increase was Tehran's way of trying to frighten protesters and prevent dissent, following a nationwide uprising sparked by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini last September. \"Iran's authorities demonstrated how crucial the death penalty is to instill societal fear in order to hold onto power,\" the report said. Iranian authorities have responded to the protests with brute force, mass arrests and hasty sham trials, drawing sharp global condemnation and sanctions from the United States. The report documented 15 executions carried out on the vaguely defined charges of \"enmity against God\" and \"corruption on Earth.\" Mohsen Shekari -- reportedly the first person to be executed in connection with the protests -- was hanged on December 8 after he was convicted of \"waging war against God\" for allegedly stabbing a member of the Basij paramilitary force, a wing of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, at a protest in Tehran on September 23. Less than a week later, Majidreza Rahnavard was also convicted for reportedly killing two members of the same paramilitary force and injuring four others on November 17. Two other Iranian young men -- Mohammad Mehdi Karami, a karate champion; and Seyed Mohammad Hosseini, a volunteer children's coach -- were hanged on January 7 this year in connection with the protests, according to Iran's judiciary news agency Mizan. They were convicted of killing a member of the Basij paramilitary force in Karaj on November 3, Mizan reported. The human rights report said they were charged with \"corruption on Earth.\" Dozens of other protesters have received death sentences in recent months. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has openly praised the Basij for its role in the crackdown, describing the protesters as \"rioters\" and \"thugs\" backed by foreign forces.  But United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Chief Volker Turk has criticized the crackdown as pushing Iran into a \"full-fledged human rights crisis.\" An 'execution machine' More than half of the executions last year took place after the protests erupted in September. Some 44% of all those sentenced to death were accused of drug-related offenses, despite no evidence of a marked rise in drug use or trafficking reported by international agencies, the report said. IHR Director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam suggested Iran would have executed even more people had it not been for \"international reactions to the death sentences against protesters\" which had \"made it difficult for the Islamic republic to proceed\" with the killings. \"To compensate, and in order to spread fear among people, the authorities have intensified executions for non-political charges. These are the low-cost victims of the Islamic republic's execution machine,\" Amiry-Moghaddam said. \"In order to stop this machine, the international community and civil society inside and outside Iran must show the same reaction to each and every execution,\" he added. In the report, the two rights groups urged the international community \"to increase efforts to support the demands of the Iranian people for respect of their fundamental human rights and the abolition of the death penalty.\"",

The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer mission, or Juice, was expected to lift off Thursday at 8:15 a.m. ET aboard an Ariane 5 rocket from Europe's Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. But a lightning risk postponed the launch, which has been rescheduled for Friday at 8:14 a.m. ET. Watch the launch live on ESA's website or YouTube channel. Weather can often cause launch delays and postponements. Specific weather criteria must be met in order for rockets to safely lift off. The James Webb Space Telescope, which launched aboard an Ariane 5 from the same location in December 2021, also faced similar delays due to adverse weather conditions around Kourou. Once launched, the spacecraft will separate from the Ariane 5 launcher after 28 minutes.

			"body": "Jeremy Grantham made his name predicting the dot-com crash in 2000 and the financial crisis in 2008. Now, the famous investor warns another epic bubble in financial markets is bursting \u2014 and the turmoil that swept through the banking sector last month is just the beginning. \"Other things will break, and who knows what they will be,\" Grantham told CNN in an exclusive interview. \"We're by no means finished with the stress to the financial system.\" The co-founder of investment firm GMO is known for his bearish views. A frenzy in multiple US markets spurred by rock-bottom interest rates after the coronavirus pandemic led Grantham to call \"one of the great bubbles of financial history\" back in 2021. Since early 2022, when the S&P 500 hit an all-time high, US stocks have dropped about 15% as central banks have jacked up borrowing costs. But Grantham sees much steeper declines on the horizon. The \"best we can hope for,\" he said, is a fall of about 27% from current levels, while the worst-case scenario would see a plunge of more than 50%. The low point might not arrive until \"deep into next year,\" he added. Analysts at Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, for their part, see the S&P 500 finishing 2023 only about 2% below Wednesday's close. Morgan Stanley foresees a drop of nearly 5%. Another Silicon Valley Bank? Stocks aren't the only assets that notched excessive valuations when cheap money encouraged investors to take big risks. The prices of government bonds, real estate and even cryptocurrencies also shot up.  This widespread exuberance could lead to a particularly harsh reckoning, according to Grantham. The recent failure of Silicon Valley Bank, for example, was triggered in part by losses on its bond holdings as interest rates jumped and prices of US government debt fell. As the bubble deflates, it's all but certain to result in an economic downturn, he predicted. \"Every one of these great bursts of euphoria, the great bubbles with overpriced markets ... has been followed by a recession,\" Grantham said. \"The recessions are mild if everybody does everything right and there [are] no complications. They are terrible if people get everything wrong.\" In the meantime, investors should \"count on being surprised,\" Grantham said. It would have been difficult to predict the implosion of Silicon Valley Bank, or the need for the Swiss government to swoop in and orchestrate an emergency rescue of Credit Suisse, he explained. \"When the great bubbles break, they do impose a lot of stress on the system,\" Grantham said. \"It's like pressure behind a dam. It's very hard to know which part will go.\" The correction in the bond market may be almost complete, Grantham forecast. But stock valuations remain \"way above any long-term traditional relationship\" to corporate performance.  Strain in the financial system could therefore grow when, as he expects, the US economy enters a recession and corporate earnings begin to take a hit. Economists at the Federal Reserve are predicting a mild recession in late 2023 because of fallout from the banking crisis. Even in this environment, though, there will be opportunities to make money. (GMO has a US equity fund, with holdings in companies such as Apple, Microsoft, ExxonMobil and Kroger.) But in the short term, \"almost everybody gets hurt\" as asset prices come back down to Earth, Grantham said. Ghosts of crises past Grantham sees uncomfortable parallels between markets today and 2000, when an explosion in the price of tech stocks was followed by a dizzying crash. There are also echoes of 2008, when a painful comedown in the US housing market almost broke the banking system. What's even more worrying is that this time, bubbles in the stock market and the real estate market are poised to burst simultaneously, Grantham said.  That's what happened in Japan in the early 1990s, unleashing a long period of economic stagnation that haunts the world's third-largest economy to this day. \"They have had basically a lost 20 years, and in addition a fairly lame 10 years,\" Grantham said. He added: \"The occasions where people have tried to break a bubble in the stock market and the real estate market together are fairly ominous.\" Fears about the health of the US commercial real estate industry have grown in recent weeks. The sector, which relies heavily on debt financing, has been hit hard by rising interest rates. The popularity of remote work has been particularly difficult for offices, a market Grantham quipped was in \"ragged disarray.\"  Meanwhile, US home prices, which hit record highs in 2022, have also started to drop as mortgage rates have leaped. What's the way out? Grantham blamed central bankers for the emergence of the latest market bubble in the United States. They pursued policies in recent decades that artificially drove up the value of financial assets, setting the stage for crashes, he said.  Every Federal Reserve chair since Alan Greenspan, who led the US central bank from 1987 to 2006, \"has followed the same policy that lower rates are good for you,\" he said. \"What has it delivered? It's delivered a series of great bubbles that then break and inflict a lot of pain.\" Jerome Powell, the current Fed chair, would be wise to follow the example of Greenspan's predecessor, Paul Volcker, according to Grantham.  Volcker raised interest rates to unprecedented levels to fight inflation in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He succeeded in curbing price rises, though his policies also led to a series of recessions. \"If Powell could just channel a little bit of Volcker, that would be a distinct improvement,\" Grantham said, suggesting that the Fed needs to stay the course on its rate hikes instead of buckling prematurely. Consumer inflation in the United States eased to 5% in March, the lowest annual rate since May 2021. That has boosted speculation among investors that the Fed could soon stop raising borrowing costs. But longer-term trends could prop up inflation for years to come, Grantham said.  Climate change is resulting in extreme weather and more intense and frequent natural disasters. That will disrupt the supply of commodities and raise food prices. Aging populations also pose a risk as smaller workforces command higher wages. \"These are not mild influences,\" Grantham said. \"These are very clear and important.\" ",

			"body": "It's watched by more than 500 million people from 140 different countries, but the Grand National remains one of the most controversial horse races in the world. Since it was first run in 1839, the spectacle has become a national institution in the United Kingdom which has transformed into the greatest steeplechase -- a race run over fences with a variety of obstacles, including \"plain fences, water jumps or open ditches\" -- on Earth. However, animal rights groups claim the race represents the \"broken relationship\" between humans and nature due to the potential dangers the horses face. The race, which has been modified in recent years to ease safety concerns, sees a field of up to 40 horses galloping 4.3 miles and jumping 30 fences the size of small cars. The demanding course has resulted in multiple fatalities over the years -- two horses died during the 2022 edition -- with many others injured and some put down as a result. \"Most people would say they love animals, so why are we OK with this?\" Animal Rising, previously called Animal Rebellion, said in a statement sent to CNN Sport. \"Whether it is for food or for sport, our relationship with animals is beyond broken.\" The animal rights group is launching its biggest ever campaign to protect animals this month and has suggested it plans to disrupt this year's Grand National, which will take place at Aintree Racecourse in Liverpool, UK, on April 15. The showpiece event is part of a three-day festival which begins on Thursday. \"This April we are launching the biggest campaign to protect animals and the climate this country has ever seen,\" Animal Rising added. \"Already over 500 people are signed up for training to take peaceful action this summer.\" Last month, a reporter from the UK newspaper The Mail on Sunday went undercover to reveal the plans the group had regarding disrupting the race. The story detailed how the organization was planning to help multiple people break onto the track with the hope of preventing the race from starting. Animal Rising says the report won't stop them from finishing their mission of raising awareness of what they claim are unethical practices. \"One undercover Mail on Sunday reporter is not going to stop teachers, nurses, and more from acting for all life and really beginning the crucial conversation about our broken relationship with other animals,\" the statement added. \"This conversation is vital if we are to tackle the root causes of our climate and ecological crises.\" The Grand National is no stranger to demonstrators looking to disrupt the race and Merseyside Police say they have a \"robust policing plan\" in place for this year's edition.  Local police say they have been working with the race organizer -- the Jockey Club -- for months in order to ensure the safety of those participating and attending the spectacle. \"We respect the right to peaceful protest and expression of views, but public order or criminal offenses will not be tolerated and will be dealt with robustly,\" a police spokesperson said, while also releasing safety advice to racegoers this week.  The Jockey Club referred CNN to the Merseyside Police when asked for comment, while Aintree Racecourse said that horse welfare and safety is \"the most important thing to the racecourse.\" Amid the controversy, thousands of attendees are once again set to descend on Aintree on Saturday for a race which animal rights activists hope will never happen.",

			"body": "The White House has declared that the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl combined with xylazine -- an animal tranquilizer that's increasingly being used in illicit drugs -- is an \"emerging threat\" facing the United States due to its role in the ongoing opioid crisis.  Administration officials call the threat FAAX, for fentanyl-adulterated or -associated xylazine.  The move, announced Wednesday, marks the first time in history that any administration has declared a substance to be an emerging threat to the country, said Dr. Rahul Gupta, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The SUPPORT Act of 2018 established that the office has authority to declare such \"emerging threats,\" and no administration has used it until now. Last year, Congress declared methamphetamine an emerging drug threat but none have been declared by an administration previously. Under other agencies or in separate circumstances, concerns such as bioterrorism, infectious diseases or climate change may be identified as \"emerging threats.\" \"This drug, which is an animal sedative, is being mixed with fentanyl and is being found in almost all 50 states now,\" Gupta said Tuesday. \"It's become an important part for us to make sure that we're declaring it an emerging threat.\" Now that the administration has declared fentanyl combined with xylazine an emerging threat, it has 90 days to coordinate a national response. \"We are working quickly to develop and implement a whole of government nationwide plan, with real deliverable action, that will save lives and will be published within 90 days of this designation,\" Gupta said. Xylazine, also known as tranq or tranq dope, has been linked to an increasing number of overdose deaths in the United States due to its rising illicit use. Between 2020 and 2021, overdose deaths involving xylazine increased more than 1,000% in the South, 750% in the West and about 500% in the Midwest, according to an intelligence report released last year by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. And in some cases, people might not even know that xylazine was in the drug they used. Just last month, authorities at the DEA issued a public safety alert about the \"widespread threat\" of fentanyl mixed with xylazine, reporting that in 2022 approximately 23% of fentanyl powder and 7% of fentanyl pills seized by the DEA contained xylazine. Fentanyl, which has been driving the opioid crisis, is a fast-acting opioid, and people who use it illicitly say that adding xylazine can extend the duration of the high the drug provides.  Xylazine is not an opioid. It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use as a tranquilizer in veterinary medicine, typically in horses, but it is not approved for use in humans. And xylazine can do major damage to the human body, including leaving drug users with severe skin ulcers, soft-tissue wounds and necrosis -- sometimes described as rotting skin -- that can lead to amputation. \"Xylazine is one of the contaminants in fentanyl, but there could be others,\" Gupta said. \"So, I think with the declaration of an emerging threat, we're sending a clear message to producers and traffickers of illicit xylazine and illicit fentanyl that we're going to respond quicker, we're going to match the challenge of evolution of these drugs supply, and that we're going to protect lives first and foremost.\"  'There is a shift that is occurring' Now that xylazine has been declared an emerging threat, some of President Biden's $46 billion drug budget request to Congress can be used to respond.  This year, the Biden administration announced that the President has called on Congress to invest $46.1 billion for agencies overseen by the Office of National Drug Control Policy to tackle the nation's illicit drug crisis. If the budget request is not approved, there could be the option to reallocate money within the Office of National Drug Control Policy, but \"we don't want to be in a position where moneys that are being utilized for some other important aspect of saving lives has to be moved away for this purpose,\" Gupta said Tuesday. \"That is the reason we are asking Congress to act.\" Such funds could be used to test drugs on the street for xylazine, collect data on FAAX, invest in care for people exposed to FAAX and develop potential treatments for a xylazine-related overdose.  The medication naloxone, also known as Narcan, is an antidote for an opioid overdose, but people who have overdosed on a combination of opioids and xylazine may not immediately wake up after taking naloxone, as it may not reverse the effects of xylazine in the same way it does opioids. \"We need to recognize, first of all, that there is a shift that is occurring from organic compounds and substances like heroin and cocaine to more synthetics,\" Gupta said of the state of the nation's illicit drug crisis.  \"Both the types of drugs have changed -- from predominantly organic to predominantly synthetics -- but the way drugs are bought and sold have also changed,\" he said. \"Now, all you need is a phone in the palm of your hand and a social media app to order and buy some of the most dangerous substances on planet Earth.\" Rise of synthetic drugs Xylazine is just one of the many adulterants -- or substances that are typically added to others -- found in the nation's illicit drug supply. \"All of a sudden, you can synthesize hundreds of compounds and kind of mix them together and see what does the best in the market,\" Joseph Friedman, a researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, told CNN in March. \"People are synthesizing new benzodiazepines, new stimulants, new cannabinoids constantly and adding them into the drug supply. So people have no idea what they're buying and what they're consuming.\" Some of these adulterants may be as simple as sugar or artificial sweeteners added for taste or additives or fillers that bulk up the drug. Sometimes, they may be contaminants left over from the manufacturing process.  But all of these things can carry real-life health harms, says Naburan Dasgupta, an epidemiologist and senior scientist at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Like an opioid, xylazine can depress the respiratory system, so the risk of overdose multiplies when it's combined with heroin or fentanyl. Also, \"in the veterinary literature, we know that it causes a really bad severe form of anemia. And so when people are injecting heroin that's contaminated with xylazine, they can end up with a near-fatal form of blood iron deficiency,\" Dasgupta said in March. \"We had one person here who ended up going to the hospital needing multiple blood transfusions. And it was all because of the xylazine.\" Move to make xylazine a controlled substance US lawmakers are moving to classify xylazine as a controlled substance. In March, bipartisan legislation -- the Combating Illicit Xylazine Act -- was introduced in the House and Senate. It describes illicit xylazine as an \"urgent threat to public health and safety\" and calls for it to be a Schedule III drug under the Controlled Substances Act, a category on the five-level system for substances with moderate to low potential for physical or psychological dependence. Xylazine would be one level below opioids like fentanyl. \"Our bipartisan bill would take important steps to combat the abuse of xylazine by giving law enforcement more authority to crack down on the illicit distribution of this drug, including by putting stiffer penalties on criminals who are spreading this drug to our communities,\" Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., said in a statement in March. The bill would also require manufacturers to send reports on production and distribution to the DEA so the agency can ensure that the product is not being diverted to the black market. \"This bill recognizes the dangers posed by the increasing abuse of animal tranquilizers by drug traffickers, and provides new tools to combat this deadly trend,\" Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said in the statement.  \"It also ensures that folks like veterinarians, ranchers and cattlemen can continue to access these drugs for bona fide animal treatment.\"",

			"body": "Jason Ballard, the CEO and co-founder of 3D printing architecture company ICON, doesn't mince his words. \"There are certain people who are content to build a really ugly or uninspiring world,\" he said. \"We're not. The day I walk outside and see something ugly being built by one of my robots -- that's a nightmare scenario for me.\" Ballard, a quick-talking Texan in a 10-gallon hat, has a vision for the future of architecture.  Others are buying into it. Since launching in 2017, Austin-based ICON has received close to half a billion dollars in funding, won a contract with NASA and paired up with influential architects like Bjarke Ingels. If all goes according to plan, ICON will be building on the moon before the end of the decade. But first, the CEO wanted to discuss a moonshot much closer to home. ICON made its name creating houses using a high strength concrete it calls \"Lavacrete,\" printed in layers to form walls. A large machine ICON named the \"Vulcan\" does the printing, fed by an on-site mixing system dubbed \"Magma.\" The company's first house was unveiled in 2018, and since then its operations have scaled up, from a collection of six homes in 2020 to a 100-home community north of Austin currently under construction (the largest printed community in the US). At each stage, the footprint of properties has increased, from 350 square feet to over 2,000 square feet, as the technology has advanced and 3D-printed homes have moved from prototype to novelty to relatively mainstream.  A thread running through ICON's work is building homes for disadvantaged people, including accommodation for the long-term homeless, often in collaboration with non-profits. Creating affordable housing is also an objective, which led the company to launch design competition Initiative 99 last month.  Initiative 99 seeks submissions for homes that can be 3D-printed for $99,000 or less. Ballard described it as \"a call to arms for the global architecture and design community\" to get to grips with \"one of the most pressing industries in need of a rethink.\" A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2021 found about half of Americans reported affordable housing was a \"major problem\" in their area. One estimate from late 2020 calculated the US had a housing supply deficit of 3.8 million units. Peggy Bailey is vice president of housing and income security at progressive US think tank the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Bailey explained that in the US, many people struggle to pay for their accommodation. \"Even before the pandemic and economic downturn, 23 million people lived in 11 million low-income households that paid more than 50% of their income for rent,\" she told CNN via email.  \"Innovative ways to build housing are a promising step toward creating more affordable housing,\" she added, while cautioning, \"the housing affordability crisis isn't due to a single issue or event. Multifaceted problems require multifaceted solutions.\" The idea for Initiative 99 came from an internal exercise ICON has run every six months for the past five years, to see what can be constructed for $99,000 with the technology available. \"This year we hit an inflection point,\" said Ballard. \"The results were very compelling. It immediately dawned on all of us (that) we've got to tell everybody about this.\" The ICON CEO said Initiative 99's $1 million prize fund will be the largest ever for an affordable housing competition. The competition will launch on May 23 and run for a year, with stages for concept development, schematic design and design development. There will be multiple winners and their designs will be built by ICON. Ballard hopes the competition receives entries tailored to meet cultures and contexts around the world, addressing specific needs and challenges.  Bailey suggested the success of 3D-printed housing could hinge on how it is perceived by prospective residents. \"One thing to keep in mind with any innovation in housing development, including 3D-development ... is that the housing must fit in the rental market and be of the quality and style that any person would want to live in,\" she said.  Off-world R&D  Ballard said all ICON's projects feed into one another: for example, the systems monitoring and support software it will use in the Initiative 99 homes was developed as part of its Project Olympus initiative, which is investigating building 3D-printed structures on the moon.  Lunar concept designs, created in collaboration with Bjarke Ingles Group, were released in 2020, and in November 2022 ICON was awarded a $57 million contract by NASA, which will culminate in testing on the moon.  Instead of Lavacrete, ICON is experimenting with using lunar regolith, the mineral-rich dust and rock that covers the moon's surface. The regolith can be melted with a laser and turned into a ceramic-like material that is hard, durable and radiation-absorbing, explained Ballard. Parts of the construction system have been tested in a vacuum, and will next be tested in simulated lunar gravity, before being sent to the moon in 2026 or 2027, he added. The CEO stressed there are no plans for a lunar base yet, but ICON's tests will represent a significant step in that direction.  Some of ICON's lunar ideas could find a civilian context too. Ballard is conscious that Lavacrete contains cement, which has a large carbon footprint, and said that ICON is researching ways to utilize locally sourced building materials on Earth that can compete with concrete. Patti Harburg-Petrich, principal at engineering consultancy Buro Happold, noted that some companies are already printing with materials other than concrete. The firm consulted on Mighty Buildings' award-winning Mighty House, in California, which utilized prefabricated, 3D-printed composite stone material for its walls.  She argued there was a strong case for 3D-printing's sustainability credentials. \"Oftentimes 3D-printed homes can be built faster and more sustainably when compared to traditional construction,\" Harburg-Petrich said via email, pointing to a reduction in building materials wasted in construction.  Achieving scale In recent years, there has been growing ambition around 3D-printing. Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, aims to have 25% of new buildings constructed with 3D-printing technology by 2030, and the city is home to the world's largest 3D-printed structure by volume -- a two-story local government office built by Apis Cor in 2019.  The first multi-story 3D-printed building in the US was unveiled in September 2022, and the tallest 3D-printed building in the world is a 9.9 meter (32.5 foot), three-story house in Saudi Arabia, completed last November -- both realized using printing technology by Danish company COBOD. Ballard says ICON is also planning to print multi-story buildings, and has triplex and quadplex designs in the works. ICON is developing the next generation of its Vulcan printing system, capable of building much bigger projects, Ballard said, adding that the company aims to eventually create a system in which three or four machines can be operated by a single person. \"You should expect it to be a lot faster, you should expect it to be a lot more autonomous,\" he added.  This thinking comes as the design and construction sectors in the US face a skilled labor shortage, noted Harburg-Petrich. Along with more affordable and transportable 3D-printing systems, in the future, \"we also need a workforce that is adaptable to 3D-printed construction technology,\" she said. 3D-construction at scale, with an emphasis on affordable housing, is where Ballard wants to take ICON. In the case of Initiative 99, the winning designs will be released for free, meaning anyone with the tools can create the houses themselves.  \"I feel like the future can be amazing,\" said Ballard. \"But I'm also haunted by this understanding of history and human behavior, because it's not guaranteed to be amazing. We have to make it so. And we're going to have to take some risks to make it so.\"",

			"body": "Our live coverage for the day has ended. Follow the latest Ukraine news\u00a0here\u00a0or read through the updates below. Two videos emerged on social media this past week that appear to show beheadings of Ukrainian soldiers. The videos appear to be of separate events. One of them may have been filmed very recently, while the other \u2014 from the amount of foliage seen on the ground \u2014 looks like it was filmed during the summer. The first video was posted to a pro-Russian social media channel on April 8. It was purportedly filmed by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner group and appears to show the beheaded corpses of two Ukrainian soldiers lying on the ground next to a destroyed military vehicle. In the video, a voice can be heard, behind the camera, the sound seemingly distorted to prevent the speaker\u2019s identification. \u201c[The armoured vehicle] got f**ked by a mine,\u201d the voice, speaking Russian, says.\u00a0 Apparently referring to the bodies on the ground, the voice, laughing, continues, \u201cThey killed them. Someone came up to them. They came up to them and cut their heads off.\u201d\u00a0 The dead soldiers also appear to have had their hands cut off.\u00a0 Russian social media accounts say the video was shot near Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, which has been the scene of the war\u2019s fiercest fighting for many months, with Wagner fighters very heavily involved. CNN is unable to independently confirm the video\u2019s location. The second video, which was posted on Twitter and is heavily blurred, looks to have been filmed during the summer because of the amount of plant life on the ground.\u00a0It purports to show a Russian fighter using a knife to cut off the head of a Ukrainian soldier. A voice at the beginning of the video suggests the victim might have still been alive when the brutal attack began. Shortly after the videos emerged, Andriy Yermak, a top advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, tweeted: \u201cThere will be an accountability for everything.\u201d  An official Ukrainian government Telegram channel said the tweet\u00a0was a direct reference to \u201canother execution video published by Russians.\u201d\u00a0 Monday, the Institute for the Study of War said that Wagner was \u201creportedly continuing to commit war crimes by beheading Ukrainian servicemen in Bakhmut,\u201d referencing a photo shared on pro-Russian social media sites showing what appeared to be a severed head mounted on a spike, which they claimed belonged to a Ukrainian soldier.\u00a0The ISW has reported similar incidents in Popasna, in the Luhansk region, where Wagner troops were also operating earlier in the war. Some pro-Russian social media accounts have suggested Ukrainian forces were responsible for the beheadings in an effort to conceal identification. This echoes a similar claim made by Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin in January after his fighters apparently found bodies with severed hands and heads near Bakhmut. The CIA assesses that Russian President Vladimir Putin is \u201cnot serious about negotiations at this stage\u201d of the war in Ukraine and it is \u201cUkrainian progress on the battlefield that is most likely to shape prospects for diplomacy\u201d to end the ongoing conflict, CIA Director Bill Burns said on Tuesday. Speaking publicly for the first time, at Rice University, since leaked classified US military documents appeared online,\u00a0Burns\u00a0stressed the importance of Ukraine\u2019s planned offensive, saying \u201ca great deal is at stake in the coming months.\u201d \u201cInstead of backing down, he has doubled down,\u201d Burns said about Putin, adding the Russian president believes he can grind down Ukraine and the West.\u00a0 The CIA director specifically mentioned that Ukraine continues to defend the Donbas region, which one of the leaked intelligence documents says is likely heading for a stalemate.  \"Russia's grinding campaign of attrition in the Donbas region is likely heading toward a stalemate, thwarting Moscow's goal to capture the entire region in 2023,\" states one of the classified documents.\u00a0 \u201cReal countries fight back,\u201d Burns said on Tuesday, adding that Ukraine and its president have done just that.\u00a0\u201cPutin was profoundly mistaken\u201d in his assumptions about Ukraine before the war, Burns added. Burns emphasized the importance of continued US support for Ukraine, including through intelligence sharing, at a time when the leaked classified documents are raising questions about the administration\u2019s view of the conflict. The CIA director made these statements at Rice University, where he's discussing Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, China\u2019s aggressive posturing, Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment and other pressing foreign policy issues at school\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy, according to the\u00a0school's website. CIA Director Bill Burns said Tuesday he expects more nuclear saber rattling from Russia as its war in Ukraine continues, but his agency does not \u201csee evidence of preparations for any potential use of nuclear weapons.\u201d Burns said the CIA does not see any \u201csignificant change in nuclear deployments by Russian leadership.\" He also said the leak of classified military documents represents an urgent problem for the US that is \u201cas intense as anything\u201d in the current moment.  Burns \u2014 stressing the importance of balancing both short-term and long-term issues \u2014  specifically pointed to the leak as an immediate problem the US intelligence agencies are grappling with. The CIA director noted that the Justice Department is currently investigating the leak and declined to elaborate further on his understanding of the issue. Burns made these statements at Rice University Tuesday, where he's discussing Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, China\u2019s aggressive posturing, Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment and other pressing foreign policy issues at school\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy, according to the school's website. ##Pentagon Docs## The highly classified leaked Pentagon documents posted to social media offer a pessimistic US view of the war's progress in Ukraine.  The documents highlight flaws in Ukraine's weaponry and air defenses and predict a stalemate in the war for months to come. The documents, which appear to date from February and March, detail many of Ukraine's perceived military shortfalls as Kyiv prepares for a spring counteroffensive against Russia.\u00a0 Several of the classified documents warn Ukraine's medium-range air defenses to protect front-line troops will be \"completely reduced by May 23,\" suggesting Russia could soon have aerial superiority and Ukraine could lose the ability to amass ground forces in a counteroffensive.\u00a0 The documents also underscore lingering problems with Russia's own military offensive, predicting that the result will be a stalemate between the two sides for the foreseeable future. Officials familiar with the situation tell CNN the documents appear to be part of a daily intelligence briefing deck prepared for the Pentagon's senior leaders, including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley.\u00a0 The leaking of the documents \u2014 many of which are marked top secret \u2014 represents a major national security breach, and the Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into who may have leaked them while the Pentagon is investigating how the leak impacts US national security.  In addition to the assessment of the Ukraine war, the documents include intelligence gathered on allies and adversaries alike. Here are the latest headlines:  UN says nearly 8,500 civilian deaths confirmed in Ukraine since invasion: The \u00a0the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said it had recorded 22,734 civilian casualties in Ukraine. between the beginning of the full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022, until April 9, 2023 \u2014 with 8,490 civilians killed and 14,244 injured. The actual figures are likely to be \u201cconsiderably higher,\u201d the OHCHR cautioned, because information from some frontline locations such as Mariupol and Severodonetsk had been delayed, with many reports pending corroboration.\u00a0\nUkraine's top national security official downplays leaked intelligence documents: Some of the information in the highly classified leaked Pentagon documents was \u201cnot secret at all,\" according to Oleksii Danilov, the head of Ukraine\u2019s National Security Council.\u00a0\"You can find it in publicly available sources,\u201c Danilov told journalist, Vassili Golod, of German broadcaster ARD,\u00a0in an interview on Sunday. Ukraine is in constant contact with its key allies, such as the US, the UK, Germany and Poland, according to Danilov.\nAmericans detained by Russia: Paul Whelan, an American wrongfully detained in Russia, was able to call home on Monday for the first time in nearly two weeks, his brother David Whelan said Tuesday. \"We been led to believe, erroneously, that Paul had been moved to LPU-21, the prison hospital,\" David Whelan said in an email to journalists. Such a move has happened in the past, leaving Paul Whelan unable to call his parents or the embassy. Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden spoke with the parents of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal correspondent detained in Russia, Tuesday. It's their first time speaking since\u00a0Gershkovich was arrested in Russia last month. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted that he had designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained Monday, and reiterated that he called on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to immediately grant consular access and release the detained journalist.\nRussia conducted a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile: Russia successfully conducted a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Tuesday, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense.\u00a0The launch from the Kapustin Yar test range in the Astrakhan region was part of testing on next-generation ICBM combat equipment, the defense ministry reports.\u00a0 ##Catch Up## Russia successfully conducted a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Tuesday, according to the Russian Ministry of Defense.\u00a0 The launch from the Kapustin Yar test range in the Astrakhan region was part of testing on next-generation ICBM combat equipment, the defense ministry reports.\u00a0 \"On April 11, 2023, a Strategic Missile Forces combat crew conducted a successful launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile from the Kapustin Yar state central joint forces test range in the Astrakhan region,\" the statement said. The launch helped confirm the correctness of schematic and structural and technical solutions used in developing new strategic missile systems the defense ministry said. The missile's test warhead hit the target at the Sary Shagan firing range (Republic of Kazakhstan) with the target accuracy, according to the statement.  \u201cThe objectives of the launch were fulfilled in full,\" the statement read.\u00a0 Back in February, Russia carried out a test of an ICBM that appears to have failed around the time\u00a0President Joe Biden was in Ukraine, according to two US officials familiar with the matter. Russia notified the United States in advance of the launch through deconfliction lines under its New START treaty obligations, one official said, adding that \"such testing is routine.\" Another official said that the test did not pose a risk to the United States and that the US did not view the test as an anomaly or an escalation. CNN's Oren Liebermann\u00a0and\u00a0Natasha Bertrand contributed to this report.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia\u2019s failure to grant consular access to wrongfully detained Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich \u201cputs it, once again, in violation of international commitments it\u2019s made.\" \u201cI think Russia not following through on meeting its obligations to consular access, never mind the practice of detaining people arbitrarily for political purposes, is going to do even more damage to Russia's standing around the world \u2014 a standing that has been in free-fall, particularly since its rei-nvasion of Ukraine last year,\u201d Blinken said at a news conference at the US State Department. \u201cI think it sends a very strong message to people around the world to beware of even setting foot there, lest they be arbitrarily detained,\u201d he said. Blinken noted that he had designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained Monday, and reiterated that he called on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to immediately grant consular access and release the detained journalist. Blinken did say what measures are being taken  to free Gershkovich, only saying that the US is \u201cengaged every single day in pressing for that access as well as pressing for Evan\u2019s release.\u201d There was no physical damage to Canadian energy infrastructure after leaked US intelligence documents appeared to show that Russian hackers were attempting to cause damage to pipelines earlier this year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed Tuesday. \u201cIn regards to the reports of cyberattacks against Canadian energy infrastructure, I can confirm that there was no physical damage to any Canadian energy infrastructure following cyberattacks,\u201d Trudeau said. Trudeau is hosting Ukraine\u2019s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, in Toronto for an official visit where Canada announced more military and humanitarian aid for the country.\u00a0 Trudeau also confirmed that his government website was down after a denial of service attack Tuesday morning. The website appeared to be functioning normally by 2:30 p.m. ET after being down for several hours.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for Russian hackers to target countries as they are showing their steadfast support for Ukraine as they are welcoming Ukrainian delegations or leadership to visit, so the timing isn't surprising,\u201d said Trudeau during a news conference alongside his Ukrainian counterpart, adding that \u201cRussia being able to bring down an official government of Canada webpage for a few hours is in no way going to dissuade us from our unshakable support of Ukraine.\" In February, Canada\u2019s Communications Security Establishment (CSE), which oversees Canada\u2019s foreign intelligence and cybersecurity, issued an alert warning.  \u201cCanadian organizations (need) to be vigilant and prepared for potential malicious cyber activity following the one-year mark of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. The Cyber Centre would like to specifically warn Canadian organizations and critical infrastructure\u00a0\u00a0operators to be prepared for the possible disruption, defacement, and attempted exploitation of Canadian network assets by cyber threat actors aligned with Russian interests,\u201d the statement reads. CSE said it would not confirm or deny any specific cyberattacks for security reasons. Canada pledged another $2.4 billion (CDN) loan to Ukraine to support essential services, such as pension payments, purchasing fuel and restoring damaged energy infrastructure. This funding will be distributed through an IMF facility and brings Canada\u2019s total contribution in this regard to about $8 billion (CDN). Canada also signed a major nuclear supply contract to provide for Ukraine\u2019s uranium needs to fuel its nuclear generators until 2035. ##Pentagon Docs## The United States has \u201cengaged with allies and partners at high levels\u201d in the days since the leak of classified documents came to light \u201cto reassure them about our own committed to safeguarding intelligence and, of course, our commitment to our security partnerships,\u201d US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday. Speaking at a news conference at the State Department, Blinken noted that he had spoken Tuesday with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and emphasized: \u201cour enduring support for Ukraine and for its efforts to defend its territorial integrity and sovereignty, its independence, reaffirmed the extraordinary support that we have provided to Ukraine along with dozens of other countries.\u201d The top US diplomat said he would not comment specifically on the \u201cpurported documents\u201d when asked about a\u00a0report\u00a0that documents showed Ukraine had engaged in attacks outside of its territory. However, Blinken noted that \u201cUkraine has to make decisions about how it can most effectively defend itself against Russian aggression and take back the territory that's been seized from it.\u201d \u201cWe give our advice as appropriate. We provide the support, that is well known, but Ukraine makes the decisions about how it actually prosecutes the effort to regain its territory,\u201d he said. The leak of classified Pentagon documents is being taken very seriously, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Tuesday. \u201cI can't say much more while the Justice Department's investigation is ongoing, but we take this very seriously,\u201d Austin said in his first public remarks about the leak. \u201cAnd we will continue to work closely with our outstanding allies and partners, and nothing will ever stop us from keeping America secure.\u201d\u00a0 Austin added that the Defense Department will \u201cturn over every rock until we find the source\u201d of the leaked intelligence documents.\u00a0 \u201cThey were somewhere in the web, and where exactly and who had access at that point we don\u2019t know, we simply don\u2019t know at this point,\u201d he said during a news conference with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and senior Philippine officials.\u00a0 Austin said the documents they are aware of are dating February 28\u00a0and March 1, and that they do not know if there are \u201cother documents\u201d that had been posted.\u00a0 \u201cAgain,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will continue to investigate in and try to determine the full scope of the activity.\u201d Austin said that he was first briefed on the \u201cunauthorized disclosure\u201d of documents on April 6 and has been convening senior leaders daily since then. More background: Highly classified Pentagon documents leaked online in recent weeks have provided a rare window into how the US spies on allies and foes alike, deeply rattling US officials, who fear the revelations could jeopardize sensitive sources and compromise important foreign relationships. Many of the documents, which US officials say are authentic, had markings indicating that they had been produced by the Joint Staff's intelligence arm, known as J2, and appear to be briefing documents. CNN\u2019s Celine Alkhaldi and Mostafa Salem contributed to this report.  ##Pentagon Docs## The White House says it has no indication Egypt is providing Russia with deadly arms for its war in Ukraine.\u00a0 A leaked US intelligence document obtained by the Washington Post indicated Egypt\u2019s military was planning to produce 40,000 rockets for Russia. It said that President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi instructed officials to keep production and shipment secret \"to avoid problems with the West.\" \"We've seen no indication that Egypt is providing lethal weaponry capabilities to Russia,\u201d\u00a0said John Kirby, a spokesman for the US National Security Council.  Kirby said Egypt remained \u201ca significant security partner\u201d and would remain so. \u201cThe United States military has a longstanding defense relationship with Egypt that goes back many, many years,\u201d he said, speaking to reporters on board Air Force One.\u00a0 The February-dated \u201ctop secret document\u201d purported conversations between Sisi and senior Egyptian military officials referencing plans to supply Russia with artillery and gunpowder, and to keep the plans a secret, the Washington Post said. CNN has not seen the document cited by the Washington Post and is not able to confirm its authenticity. An Egyptian official, unnamed by state-affiliated media, called the Washington Post report \u201cinformational absurdity\u201d and said that Egypt follows a \u201cbalanced policy\u201d with all international parties, Al Qahera News, a state-affiliated media outlet said. The statement was carried by several Egyptian state-affiliated news outlets. Kirby refused to confirm the validity of the document and declined to detail any diplomatic conversations between Washington and Cairo.\u00a0 ##Pentagon Docs## The family of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who has been detained in Russia, released a statement on Tuesday calling for his release. \u201cWe are encouraged that the State Department has officially designated Evan as wrongfully detained. We appreciate President Biden\u2019s call to us today, assuring us that the U.S. government is doing everything in its power to bring him home as quickly as possible,\" the statement said. The statement continued:  \"In addition to being a distinguished journalist, Evan is a beloved son and brother. There is a hole in our hearts and in our family that won\u2019t be filled until we are reunited. We are grateful for the outpouring of support from his colleagues, friends and everyone standing with Evan and advocating for his immediate release.\u201d The United Arab Emirates rejected reports suggesting that Russian intelligence was touting\u00a0deepened ties with the Emirati government and planned to work against the United States and the United Kingdom, as reported by the Associated Press \u2014 citing an apparent intelligence document from the US.\u00a0 The purported intelligence document which was posted online and viewed by the AP cited research reportedly from March 9 with the title \u201cRussia/UAE: Intelligence Relationship Deepening,\u201d that said US spies caught Russian intelligence officers boasting that they had convinced the UAE to \u201cwork together against US and UK intelligence agencies.\u201d\u00a0 CNN has not seen the document cited by AP, and both have been unable to confirm its authenticity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cUAE officials have not seen any of the referenced materials, and any purported claims referenced in the Associated Press regarding the FSB enquiries are categorically false,\u201d an official from the UAE told CNN in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cWe refute any allegation regarding an agreement to deepen cooperation between the UAE and other countries\u2019 security services against another country,\u201d the official said.\u00a0\u201cThe UAE has deep and distinguished relations with all countries \u2026 and is committed to adherence to international law and respect for the sovereignty of states,\u201d the official said.\u00a0 The source spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing longstanding norms around the government's communications with the media.

It's their first time speaking since\u00a0Gershkovich was arrested in Russia last month. Biden told reporters, before boarding Air Force One, that he planned to speak with\u00a0Gershkovich's parents. He connected with them aboard the plane as he flew to Northern Ireland, according to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.\u00a0 \"The president made it clear that his national security team has been and will remain focused on securing Evan\u2019s release as well as that of Paul Whelan,\" she said, referring to a second American who has been detained in Russia for several years. She said the charges of espionage against\u00a0Gershkovich were baseless and said \"he should be released immediately.\" The apparent leak of US classified information \"has demonstrated a serious level of inaccuracy,\" the UK's Ministry of Defence said Tuesday.\u00a0 \"Readers should be cautious about taking at face value allegations that have the potential to spread disinformation,\" the ministry said in a brief statement posted on its official Twitter feed.\u00a0 Ukraine's response: Mykhailo Podolyak, the adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said on his Telegram channel Friday that he believes the documents that have been disseminated are inauthentic, have \u201cnothing to do with Ukraine\u2019s real plans\u201d and are based on \u201ca large amount of fictitious information\u201d spread by Russia. But while Ukrainian officials brushed off the leak, Ukraine has already altered some of its military plans because of it, a source close to Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0told CNN. What's in the documents: CNN has reviewed 53 leaked documents, all of which appear to have been produced between mid-February and early March. They contain a wide range of highly classified information \u2013 providing a rare window into how the US spies on allies and adversaries alike. US allies are doing damage assessments, scrambling to determine whether any of their own sources and methods have been compromised by the leak. \u201cWe expect the US to share a damage assessment with us in the coming days, but we cannot wait for their assessment. Right now, we are doing our own,\u201d said an official from a country that is part of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing arrangement with the US, which includes Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

The interagency probe is being led by the Pentagon\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Security, according to three US officials, and could take months to complete. It will chiefly examine whether any sources and methods have been compromised since the documents, many of which are marked \"top secret,\" were\u00a0posted on a social media platform\u00a0earlier this year. Milancy Harris, the deputy under secretary of defense for intelligence and security, will be in charge of the effort on the Pentagon side, officials said. The investigation will also try to determine the scope of the leak, since officials do not yet know whether it has been contained or whether there are more classified documents still circulating online. The Pentagon effort is not focused on the source of the leak, one senior Pentagon official said. But the Defense Department will be examining how it distributes highly classified information and whether it needs to change who receives it on a daily basis. \u201cWay too many people have access to very sensitive information,\u201d a senior US official told CNN, noting that \u201cthousands\u201d of people likely saw these documents before they hit the internet. The leaked materials appear to be photos of documents that were crumpled up and wrinkled, as though they had been folded and stuffed in a pocket. While many officials tend to take classified information home, one senior US official said, the fact that the paper was folded up \u201ctells me this person did not have that authority.\u201d Read more about the investigations here.  Wagner founder and financier Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed on Tuesday that Russian forces now control much of the embattled eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut.\u00a0 \u201cWe are fully concentrated on Bakhmut, continuing to carry out combat missions. In Bakhmut, most of it \u2014 that is, more than 80% \u2014 is under our control, including the entire administrative center, plants, factories, the city administration,\u201d Prigozhin\u00a0said. \u201cWhat is left is part of the multi-story residential areas, where fortification districts were made. There are tunnels under these high-rise buildings.\u201d Ukrainian officials have denied Prigozhin\u2019s claim. \"This statement by Prigozhin is not true,\u201d\u00a0Serhii Cherevatyi, spokesperson for the eastern grouping of the Ukrainian Armed Forces told CNN on Tuesday. \u201cI've just been in touch with the commander of one of the brigades that are defending the city. I can confidently state that the Ukrainian defense forces control a much larger percentage of the territory of Bakhmut.\" \"Prigozhin needs to show at least some victory in the city, which they have been trying to capture for nine months in a row, so he makes such statements,\" Cherevatyi added.\u00a0 The Wagner founder has been known to make incorrect claims about his forces\u2019 advance on the ground in Ukraine. Last week, he posted a grainy video raising a flag at dawn, saying Bakhmut had \"been taken,\" despite ongoing fighting in and around the city. His claim was seen as a \"pretty desperate\" attempt, Western officials said. What Western officials are saying: The officials conceded Russia had been able to make some progress in Bakhmut, but added it could be \"measured in meters.\" \"The Russians at the moment, despite trying for six months, with huge numbers of personnel and huge numbers of losses, have been unable to take the town, and at the moment have made very, very slow progress,\u201d the officials said at a briefing last Wednesday.\u00a0 In the video this Tuesday, Prigozhin said Wagner fighters had relinquished control of some areas around Bakhmut to the Russian military.\u00a0 \u201cWe handed over the flanks to the Ministry of Defence. Units of the Ministry of Defence, including the airborne troops, have today taken over both the right and left flanks,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why Zaliznyanskoye, Nikolaevka, and other settlements, which were stormed by units of the Wagner PMC in previous months, are in the area of responsibility of the airborne troops and other units of the Ministry of Defence.\u201d CNN\u2019s Max Foster contributed to this post.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has reassured Ukraine of the United States\u2019 support following a leak of classified Pentagon documents, according to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. During a call on Tuesday, Blinken \u201creaffirmed the ironclad U.S. support and vehemently rejected any attempts to cast doubt on Ukraine\u2019s capacity to win on the battlefield,\u201d Kuleba wrote Tuesday on Twitter, adding that the US \"remains Ukraine's trustworthy partner.\"  The comments come after a number of highly classified Pentagon documents were released online in recent weeks. Some divulge\u00a0key weaknesses in Ukrainian weaponry, air defense, and battalion sizes and readiness at a\u00a0critical point in the war, as Ukrainian forces gear up to launch a counteroffensive against the Russians \u2013 and just as the US and Ukraine have begun to develop a more mutually trusting relationship over intelligence-sharing. CNN's Natasha Bertrand and Kylie Atwood contributed reporting to this post.  ##Pentagon Docs## US President Joe Biden told reporters that he planned to speak to the family of jailed Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich during his flight to Northern Ireland today.  The US State Department formally designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained by Russia, and Biden said that he tried to speak to Gershkovich\u2019s family on Monday but would attempt again today. \u201cWe\u2019re making it real clear that it\u2019s totally illegal what\u2019s happening. And we declared it, so changes the dynamic,\u201d he said. A senior Egyptian official denied that Egypt\u2019s military was planning to produce 40,000 rockets for Russia, following a report from The Washington Post citing a leaked US intelligence document, Egyptian state-affiliated media said. A leaked US intelligence document obtained by The Washington Post said Egypt\u2019s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi instructed officials to keep production and shipment secret \"to avoid problems with the West.\" The \"top secret\" document from February contains purported conversations between Sisi and senior Egyptian military officials, according to the newspaper. It referenced plans to supply Russia with artillery and gunpowder, with Sisi asking officials to keep the plans a secret, The Washington Post reported. CNN has not seen the document cited by the Washington Post and is not able to confirm its authenticity. The unnamed Egyptian official called the report \"informational absurdity\" and said that Egypt follows a \"balanced policy\" with all international parties, according to Al Qahera News, a state-affiliated media outlet. The statement was also carried by several other Egyptian state-affiliated news outlets. Egypt is one of the world\u2019s top recipients of US military aid, receiving\u00a0$1.3 billion in military financing annually. What Russia says: Russia\u2019s Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the information a \"hoax.\" \"It looks like another hoax, of which there are plenty now. This is how you should treat such publications,\" Peskov said in response to a question from a journalist on the report. CNN has reached out to the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment. Remember: Highly classified Pentagon documents leaked online in recent weeks have provided a rare window into how the US spies on allies and foes alike, deeply rattling US officials, who fear the revelations could jeopardize sensitive sources and compromise important foreign relationships.

Investigations and impact: The US Justice Department is investigating how the trove of highly sensitive documents ended up on social media sites.  The Defense Department is still reviewing the matter and has taken steps to tighten the flow of such highly sensitive documents, officials said, which are normally available on any given day to hundreds of people across the government. While the Pentagon has stood up an \u201cinteragency effort\u201d to assess the impact of the leak, US officials and close allies already fear the revelations could jeopardize sensitive sources and compromise important foreign relationships.

The Kremlin said\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0the amendments to military conscription legislation are not connected to mobilization, dismissing rumors of a new wave of enlistment in Russia. Asked during a regular call with reporters if the Kremlin is concerned that the proposed law, if passed, would trigger another wave of a mass exodus of Russians, spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, \"Absolutely not. It has nothing to do with mobilization; it has to do with military registration.\"\u00a0 \"There is no second wave,\" Peskov said after being pressed further to respond to the rumors of an upcoming second wave of mobilization. The State Duma published the bill on Tuesday. According to the document, electronic summonses for military service will be equated to paper summons. Currently, conscription documents in Russia must be hand-delivered by the local military enlistment office or through an employer. A person will be considered notified even if they have not seen the call-up papers or email and from the moment of receipt of the summons. Those liable for military service will be banned from traveling abroad. Remember: Russia\u2019s \"partial mobilization\" for its war in Ukraine, which was announced in September, resulted in a significant number of citizens fleeing Russia, as CNN previously reported. The Kremlin acknowledged mistakes were made in its military draft process, but maintains there is no discussion of a new wave of mobilization. \u00a0 Nearly 8,500 civilians are confirmed to have been killed since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said in a\u00a0statement Monday. The OHCHR said it had recorded 22,734 civilian casualties in Ukraine between the beginning of the full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022 until April 9, 2023 \u2014 with 8,490 civilians killed and 14,244 injured. The actual figures are likely to be \u201cconsiderably higher,\u201d the OHCHR cautioned, because information from some frontline locations such as Mariupol and Severodonetsk had been delayed, with many reports pending corroboration.\u00a0 Most confirmed civilian deaths occurred in Ukrainian government-controlled territory that is under attack by Russia, according to the OHCHR, with 3,927 killed in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which have seen some of the bloodiest battles in the war so far. At least 1,894 civilians have been killed in territory occupied by the Russian Federation when the casualties occurred, the OHCHR said.\u00a0 Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB) has detained a man on suspicion of treason, state news agency TASS reported Tuesday. He is accused of transferring money to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The man was detained in Khabarovsk, a city in Russia\u2019s southeast, after making \u201ctransfers of personal funds for the purchase of weapons, ammunition and uniforms by the Armed Forces of Ukraine,\u201d the FSB said, according to TASS. He faces a prison sentence of 12 to 20 years and a possible additional fine of up to 500,000 rubles (around $6,000) if found guilty of treason, TASS reported. Some of the information in the highly classified leaked Pentagon documents was \u201cnot secret at all,\" according to the head of Ukraine\u2019s National Security Council.\u00a0 \"You can find it in publicly available sources,\u201c Oleksii Danilov told journalist, Vassili Golod of German broadcaster ARD,\u00a0in an interview on Sunday. Ukraine is in constant contact with its key allies, such as the US, the UK, Germany and Poland, according to Danilov. \"The data for conducting certain operations, the size of the units, who is involved and in what direction - this information is absolutely secret. If someone thinks he has it, I can only congratulate him. But I don't know where he could have them from,\" he said. \u201cFor the other part of the information - if it was indeed secret - the agencies in the United States and the United Kingdom will know exactly where it came from. And why it surfaced at this particular time,\" added Danilov. The start of Ukraine\u2019s planned counteroffensive will be decided by the staff of the Commander-in-Chief at the very last moment, stressed Danilov.  \"If someone believes that we have only one option, it does not correspond to reality. Even three options would not be much,\" Danilov said in the interview. \"Intelligence agencies need to be more vigilant when it comes to classified documents,\" he added.\u00a0 Some context: Ukraine has had to alter some of its military plans after the leak of highly classified Pentagon documents, a source close to Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelenskytold CNN. However, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, has said he believes the documents have \u201cnothing to do with Ukraine\u2019s real plans\u201d and are based on \u201ca large amount of fictitious information\u201d disseminated by Russia. ##Pentagon Docs## Paul Whelan, an American wrongfully detained in Russia, was able to call home on Monday for the first time in nearly two weeks, his brother David Whelan said Tuesday. \"We been led to believe, erroneously, that Paul had been moved to LPU-21, the prison hospital,\" David Whelan said in an email to journalists. Such a move has happened in the past, leaving Paul Whelan unable to call his parents or the embassy. \"The Ministry of Defense did come to IK-17 to recruit prisoners to become war criminals like the rest of the Russian military. But Paul and some other prisoners were sequestered within IK-17, not transferred out,\" he said.\u00a0 \"The prison administration claims that the phones have been out of order from March 30 through to April 9th or 10th. Russia's infrastructure appears so brittle it could be true, or the prison could just be playing silly buggers again,\" David Whelan said. David Whelan said it seemed his brother has become aware of the case of another wrongfully detained American \u2014 Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. \"Paul's fear of being left behind a third time was apparently palpable in his conversation with our parents yesterday,\" David Whelan said. \"We have asked our parents to express to Paul that Elizabeth and I can't conceive a scenario where the U.S. government conceded anything to the Kremlin for an American's release that did not include Paul. It would be an unconscionable betrayal.\" The Biden administration has urged the Russians to immediately release both Gershkovich and Paul Whelan. South Korea has claimed that a \"considerable amount\" of the material leaked from the Pentagon was fabricated, as US officials scramble to contain the effects of the leak. Elsewhere, Ukrainian refugees continue to cross the border into Poland, with 400,000 new arrivals in the past week taking the total number to 11 million since the start of the invasion. Here are the latest headlines: Ukrainian adviser pushes for more weapons: Ukraine needs more long-range weapons and \u201cless contemplation on leaks,\u201d said Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak, referring to the recent leak of classified Pentagon documents.\nSouth Korea claims leaked material was fabricated: South Korea's presidential office claims the defense ministers of South Korea and the United States have agreed that a \u201cconsiderable amount\u201d of information in the leaked Pentagon documents was fabricated, after the leak revealed a conversation among Korean officials on the war in Ukraine. \nUkraine PM in Canada: Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has arrived in Canada ahead of a meeting with his Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau.\u00a0In an interview with Canada\u2019s Globe and Mail newspaper last week, Shmyhal said he would request ammunition and heavily armored vehicles.\u00a0\nRefugees continue to flee to Poland: More than 11 million Ukrainian refugees have fled to Poland since Russia invaded in February 2022, according to Poland\u2019s EU representation, with nearly 400,000 people crossing the border in the last week.\u00a0\nKremlin says US journalist broke law: Detained US journalist Evan Gershkovich  \"was caught red-handed and violated the relevant laws of the Russian Federation,\" said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday, in response to the US State Department designating him wrongfully detained.\nLong sentence for arson protest in Russia: A military court has sentenced two Russian men to 19 years in jail for setting a fire at a local administration building where a military registration desk was located, state media reported Monday.\u00a0One of the men said the incident was a protest against the war in Ukraine. ##Catch Up## Detained US journalist Evan Gershkovich violated Russian law, the Kremlin maintained Tuesday, in response to the\u00a0US State Department having designated him as being wrongfully detained. \u201cThe United States could and should protect the rights of its citizen, who was caught red-handed and violated the relevant laws of the Russian Federation. That is what he is suspected of. That is all I can say,\u201d Russian government spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists during a regular conference call. Russian investigators formally charged Gershkovich\u00a0with espionage, Russian state media reported, adding he denied the accusations.\u00a0A Moscow court on April 18 will hear an appeal filed by Gershkovich\u2019s lawyers against his arrest, Russian state media said citing the court. The correspondent is currently held in the notorious Leftereovo pre-detention center until May 29. What the US is saying: CNN reported on Monday that the US State Department officially designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained by Russia. The designation gives further backing to the assertions by the US government and the Wall Street Journal that the espionage charges against the reporter are baseless. It will empower the Biden administration to explore avenues\u00a0such as a prisoner swap to try to secure Gershkovich\u2019s release. CNN's Jennifer Hansler contributed to this post.  Ukraine needs more long-range weapons and \u201cless contemplation on leaks,\u201d said Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak,\u00a0referring to the recent leak of classified Pentagon documents. \u201cIf we had time, we could watch the RF [the Russian Federation] fall apart & its \u2018elites\u2019 devour each other. But we don't have it, as our people are dying,\" tweeted Podolyak, an advisor to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, on Tuesday  \u201cWe need less contemplation on \u2018leaks\u2019 and more long-range weapons in order to properly end the war and make the RF face the reality.\u201d\u00a0 Some context: Ukraine has pushed for long range weapons in order to be able to strike ammunition depots and logistics hubs that Russian forces have moved out of range of existing systems. In January, Ukrainian officials asked for longer range missiles that can reach inside Russia. But Western allies have so far been careful not to provide Ukraine with systems that can reach Russia in order to reduce the risk of escalating the conflict. CNN's Tim Lister\u00a0and\u00a0Fred Pleitgen contributed to this post.  ##Pentagon Docs## A military court has sentenced two Russian\u00a0men\u00a0to 19 years in jail for setting a fire at a local administration building where a military registration desk was located, state media reported Monday. On October 11, 2022, Roman Nasryev and Alexey Nuriev threw a Molotov cocktail into the window of the government building in the town of Bakal, in Russia\u2019s Chelyabinsk region, according to investigators cited by Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. The two men were found guilty of committing \u201ca terrorist act by a group of persons by prior conspiracy\u201d and of \u201ctraining for carrying out terrorist activities.\u201d Nuriev was reportedly the commander of the fire and rescue service of the Ministry of Emergencies, and Nasryev was a driver for the National Guard (Rosgvardia), local news website 74.ru said. The verdict marks the most severe sentence to date for anti-war arson, according to\u00a0the human rights group\u00a0Solidarity Zone, which believes\u00a0the lengthy sentence\u00a0could be because both men were working for government institutions. In March, Solidarity Zone reported that Nasryev told the court he \u201cdecided to take a similar action, because I did not agree with the mobilization, the \u2018special military operation\u2019 and the war in general.\u201d \u201cThis way I wanted to convey my position of disagreement, I wanted my voice to be heard,\u201d Nasryev added. Some context: Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a \"partial mobilization\" in September 2022, meaning citizens who are in the reserve could be called up, and those with military experience would be subject to conscription. More recently, Russian officials have consistently denied rumors of a second mobilization. More than 11 million Ukrainian refugees have fled to Poland since Russia invaded in February 2022, Poland\u2019s EU representation tweeted on Tuesday. \u00a0\u00a0  Around 87% of those crossing the border are woman and children, it added. At the beginning of April, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that just over 10.6 million people had crossed the border.  This means that nearly 400,000 people have travelled from Ukraine to Poland in the last week.\u00a0 There are currently more than 1.5 million Ukrainian refugees living in Poland and more than 3.5 million Ukrainian refugees settled in other European countries, the UNHCR reports. \"All those fleeing the war will find shelter and all the help they need in Poland,\u201d Poland\u2019s EU representation added. \u00a0 Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has arrived in Canada ahead of a meeting with his Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau, according to his official Twitter account. Shmyhal said Canada was among the first countries to \u201cstand with Ukraine,\u201d and the two governments are \u201cpreparing new agreements and deals to strengthen the macro-financial and economic stability of Ukraine.\" In an interview with Canada\u2019s\u00a0Globe and Mail\u00a0newspaper last week, Shmyhal said he would request ammunition and heavily armored vehicles.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s crucially important for the organization of our counteroffensive,\" he told the Globe. South Korea's presidential office claims the defense ministers of South Korea and the United States have agreed that a \u201cconsiderable amount\u201d of information in the leaked Pentagon documents was fabricated, after the leak revealed a conversation among Korean officials on the war in Ukraine. \"On the US government\u2019s alleged wiretapping, the defense ministers of the two countries agreed that \u2018a considerable amount of the documents were fabricated,\u2019\u201d the presidential office said in a statement without providing further details.  The statement did not specify whether they believe that only the parts about South Korea is fabricated, or the documents in general.\u00a0 CNN has asked the presidential office why they believe some of the information has been fabricated. CNN cannot independently confirm if any of the documents have been altered or fabricated. The leaked conversation: The leaked documents described a conversation between two senior South Korean national security officials over a US request for ammunition.\u00a0\u00a0 The officials worried that supplying the ammunition, which the US would then send to Ukraine, would violate South Korea\u2019s policy of not supplying lethal aid to countries at war. According to the document, one of the officials then suggested a way of getting around the policy without actually changing it \u2013 by selling the ammunition to Poland. In previous CNN reporting, a US official said the leaked documents \"look real.\" Seoul's response: South Korea said its Defense Minister Lee Jong-sup had held a phone call with his US counterpart Lloyd Austin on Tuesday morning, at Austin's request. On the call, Austin explained recent media coverage of the leak and said the US would \"closely communicate and fully cooperate\" with Seoul on this issue, according to South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry. CNN has not a received a readout of the call from the office of the US Secretary of Defense. CNN has reached out to the US Department of Defense for comment, and for a readout of the call, but has not yet received a response. Here's what we know about the leak. ##Pentagon Docs## In his nightly address on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky celebrated the release of some Ukrainian prisoners of war, vowing to \"return everyone.\" Russia and Ukraine exchanged more than 200 prisoners in their latest swap, with 80 men and 20 women returning to Ukraine.  \"These are a hundred families who got real joy on the eve of Easter. And, of course, we keep working to return all our people from Russian captivity,\" Zelensky said. \"We remember everyone! And we will return everyone!\" Diplomatic efforts: He also outlined ongoing foreign policy and diplomacy efforts; on Monday, he met prominent British entrepreneur Richard Branson, spoke with the Greek prime minister and struck an agreement with the Iraqi prime minister. Zelensky added that Germany continues to provide defense assistance, including armored vehicles, ammunition, medicine and more. Boosting Ukraine's defense capabilities \"protects everyone in the partner countries, everyone in Europe, everyone in the world,\" he added. \"The term 'defeat' should become a companion to the term 'aggressor', and it is only the Ukrainian victory that will ensure this,\" Zelensky said.  Russia is using \"scorched Earth\" tactics as it tries to take the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, according to Ukraine's top land commander. Across the country's east, Ukraine is continuing to repel Russian attacks, the military says.  A prisoner swap saw 200 servicemen exchanged; meanwhile, the fallout from the Pentagon leak of classified documents continues, with the Kremlin denying any involvement. Here are the latest headlines: Russia devastating Bakhmut:\u00a0Russia is using airstrikes and artillery to destroy Bakhmut, in what one commander has called \"scorched Earth\" tactics. Meanwhile, Ukraine is working to repel Russian forces in the country's east, with more than 20 attacks repelled within 24 hours, according to Ukraine's General Staff of the Armed Forces.\nDetained reporter: The US State Department officially declared the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich was \"wrongfully detained.\" Gershkovich is being held in Russia, and this designation will empower the US government to explore every avenue to try to secure his release.\nPrisoner swap: Russia and Ukraine exchanged more than 200 prisoners of war in their latest swap. Moscow's Defense Ministry said it received 106 Russian servicemen, while Ukraine's presidential office head said 100 Ukrainians were returned home \u2014 including troops who had fought to defend Mariupol, Hostomel and Azovstal.\nUkraine on the Pentagon leak: A Ukrainian Defense Ministry representative on intelligence accused Russia of using altered versions of the highly classified Pentagon documents leaked online to spread disinformation. \"In recent decades, Russia's most successful\u00a0intelligence operations\u00a0have been carried out in Photoshop,\" said Andrii Yusov.\nMoscow's response: Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed accusations that Moscow may have been involved in the leak.\u00a0\u201cThe tendency to always\u00a0blame Russia\u00a0for everything and blame everything on Russia is now a common disease,\u201d he said. ##Catch Up## The recent leak of classified US military documents, if authentic, could have deadly consequences for the Ukrainians in the war with Russia, said the top Democrat on the US House intelligence committee.\u00a0 \u201cIt won\u2019t be hard for the Russians to cut off [intelligence] collection avenues that might have been saving lives every day,\u201d Rep. Jim Himes said on Monday. \u00a0 \u201cAnything that points to sources and methods carries the very real risk that those sources and methods go away,\u201d Himes said. \u201cAnd that can mean people being killed, that can mean technologies being shut down. And that translates into bad outcomes on the battlefield.\u201d\u00a0 Himes emphasized that he had not been briefed on the documents and could not independently corroborate their authenticity. But US officials have told CNN that the documents appear real. The fallout: US allies are doing damage assessments, scrambling to determine whether any of their own sources and methods have been compromised by the leak.  Himes said he worried that the closest of US allies \u2014\u00a0the so-called \"Five Eyes\" intelligence partnership that includes Australia Canada, New Zealand and the UK \u2014\u00a0\u201cmight think twice about sharing their most sensitive intelligence\u201d because of the leak. The leak has also led the Pentagon to take steps to tighten the flow of such highly sensitive documents, US officials have said. ##Pentagon Docs## Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter who is being held in Russia, has been designated as wrongfully detained by the US State Department.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cToday, Secretary Blinken made a determination that Evan Gershkovich is wrongfully detained by Russia,\u201d State Department principal deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said in a statement Monday. The designation underscores the United States government\u2019s statements that the espionage charges against the reporter are baseless, and it will empower the US government to explore every avenue to try to secure his release.\u00a0 Gershkovich\u2019s case will now be handled at the State Department through the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs.\u00a0\u00a0 Both of the Americans who have been recently brought home from Russia \u2014 Trevor Reed and Brittney Griner \u2014 had been designated as wrongfully detained, and were freed in prisoner swaps.\u00a0 Paul Whelan, who remains imprisoned in Russia, also has been declared wrongfully detained.\u00a0 In his statement, Patel said the \u201cU.S. government will provide all appropriate support to Mr. Gershkovich and his family.\u201d \u201cWe call for the Russian Federation to immediately release Mr. Gershkovich,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also call on Russia to release wrongfully detained U.S. citizen Paul Whelan.\u201d US State Department Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman has been tapped to lead the diplomatic response to the leak of highly classified Pentagon documents, according to a US official familiar with the matter. US government officials \u201care engaging with allies and partners at high levels over this including to reassure them of our commitment to safeguarding intelligence and the fidelity of securing our partnerships\u201d following the mass leak of highly classified documents, State Department principal deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said Monday. Patel would not go into details about which countries they had engaged, saying \u201cthat work is ongoing.\u201d Asked by CNN if the State Department is taking the lead on those conversation, Patel said that \u201cas the main diplomatic branch and agency of this administration, of course the Department of State would have a role in communicating with our allies and partners, but these conversations are happening across the administration.\u201d \u201cUS officials are engaging with allies and partners at the highest level over this,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Patel would not say if any steps had been taken to restrict access to classified information at the State Department as a result of the leak, saying he did not want to discuss policy decisions.\u00a0 CNN has reported that some of the leaked documents included intelligence related to the war in Ukraine.  International response: Patel would not speak on specific comments from South Korean and Israeli officials reacting to leaked documents.\u00a0South Korea\u2019s presidential office said it will hold \u201cnecessary discussions with the US\u201d regarding the document leak, which comes as the relationship between Seoul and Washington is already strained due to South Korean anger over the Inflation Reduction Act harming South Korea\u2019s electronic vehicle industry and concerns related to the US CHIPS Act.  \u201cThere is a lot of frustration towards the Yoon administration for being too committed to the US alliance so every aspect of the US-South Korea relationship is under the microscope,\u201d said a former US Ambassador to South Korea.\u00a0\u00a0 The South Korean president is scheduled to visit the White House later this month, making the timing around this incident particularly unfortunate the former diplomat said.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDoes Yoon have to raise this during the State Visit? We don\u2019t know yet,\u201d the diplomat said More broadly, one diplomat from a NATO country told CNN that they do not believe Moscow was overly surprised by the most of the intel that was revealed in the leaked documents, noting Russia has robust intelligence gathering operations.\u00a0 They also said that they were not frustrated that there was US intelligence that was not widely shared with allies. This diplomat said most nations do not share everything with their allies nor is there an expectation that they do so.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s not the way it works,\u201d the diplomat said. ##Pentagon Docs## The Pentagon is still working to determine the scale of a leak of classified information that has occurred in recent weeks, Chris Meagher, assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs, said Monday.\u00a0 CNN has reported that some of the leaked documents included intelligence related to the war in Ukraine.  \u201cThe Department of Defense is working around the clock to look at the scope and scale of the distribution, the assessed impact, and our mitigation measures,\u201d Meagher said. \u201cWe're still investigating how this happened, as well as the scope of the issue. There have been steps to take a closer look at how this type of information is distributed and to whom. We\u2019re also still trying to assess what might be out there.\u201d\u00a0 Meagher said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was first briefed on the leak on April 6 and began \u201cconvening senior leaders on a daily basis\u201d the next day.\u00a0 Over the weekend, US officials engaged with allies and partners \u2014\u00a0some of whom were also implicated in the document leak, Meagher said.  The\u00a0Pentagon\u00a0team is also working to determine if the leak of classified material includes the Defense Department\u2019s legislative affairs, public affairs, policy, general counsel, intelligence and security, and joint staff offices, Meagher said.\u00a0 Meagher said the team is a \u201ccoordinated effort amongst several different components of DOD\u201d who were all working to \u201cget our arms around everything that has to do with\u201d the leak. Meagher declined to say who specifically was in charge of that team and overseeing those efforts. ##Pentagon Docs##",

			"headline": "Inside ICON: The 3D printing architecture company with out of this world ambition",
			"section": "architecture",
			"mappedSection": "STYLE",
			"body": "Texas-based ICON is a 3D printing company that has rapidly ascended through the architecture world. Founded in 2017, it has a contract with NASA to develop 3D-printed structures on the moon (pictured: a concept rendering). But first, ICON is launching a competition to address one of the building industry's most pressing issues back on Earth: affordable housing. Pictured, ICON co-founders Alexander Le Roux, Jason Ballard and Evan Loomis pose next to one of the company's Vulcan 3D printing systems in 2021. ICON is launching Initiative 99, a design competition with a prize fund of $1 million, for homes that can be built for $99,000 or less. Ballard described it as \"a call to arms for the global architecture and design community.\" The Chicon House, completed by ICON in 2018, became the first permitted 3D-printed home in the United States. The walls of the two-bedroom home were printed in 47 hours with ICON's first-generation printer.  The East 17th Street Residences, completed in 2021, represent ICON's first 3D-printed community, combining two and four-bedroom houses.  The East 17th Street Residences were designed by Logan Architecture and sold within days of listing in March 2021, according to ICON.  House Zero in East Austin is a building concept designed with sustainability in mind, according to ICON. The three-bedroom home covers over 2,000 square feet, has a mid-century aesthetic, and has received multiple accolades.  Community First! Village is a six-home ICON project from 2020, created in collaboration with nonprofit Mobile Loaves & Fishes, providing housing for the long-term homeless. ICON's largest project is currently underway north of Austin in the city of Georgetown. Wolf Ranch is a 100-home community built in collaboration with construction company Lennar. Prices for units will start in the mid-$400,000s.  The homes will cost roughly the median price for a house in the Austin area, according to CEO Jason Ballard. Supporters of 3D-printing say it can speed up construction and reduce labor costs. ICON is teaming up with frequent collaborator BIG (Bjarke Ingels Group) and hotelier Liz Lambert for a 3D-printed hotel in Marfa, Texas. Concept imagery for El Cosmico was released in March. The 60-acre site will feature a spa, pool, communal facilities and hospitality spaces, as well as guest rooms. The hotel's guest room concepts lean into the complex shapes ICON can create with its printing system. \"My old joke is we can print you a house in the shape of a Fibonacci spiral,\" said Ballard. \"Of course, if you want the square, we can do the square too.\" Project Olympus is ICON's off-world construction initiative, originating as a collaboration with BIG. Renderings, including this one, were released in 2020, and last year the company was awarded a $57 million contract by NASA to develop its system. ICON is experimenting with printing using lunar regolith (moon dust), melting it with a laser to create a ceramic-like material. Ballard said ICON is trialing parts of its system in a vacuum, and will conduct tests in simulated lunar gravity next, ahead of testing on the moon in 2026 or 2027 (concept rendering pictured). On the moon, horizontal surfaces like roads and landing pads will be created first, before vertical print tests commence, which could enable the construction of hangars and habitats.

The Vulcan system printed the 1,700 square-foot Martian base inside a hangar at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas in 2021. The walls of Mars Dune Alpha under construction. The completed base for NASA's Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog (CHAPEA) missions is yet to be unveiled. The first of three year-long missions is set to begin in June 2023, simulating a long-term stay on Mars.",

			"body": "The James Webb Space Telescope has spied colorful, never-before-seen details in one of the most well-observed remnants of an exploded star. The glowing gas and dust of Cassiopeia A is all that remains of a star that exploded in a supernova, and its light reached Earth for the first time 340 years ago. It's the youngest known supernova remnant in our galaxy, which is why the celestial object has been studied by a multitude of ground and space-based telescopes.  Cassiopeia A is located 11,000 light-years away in the Cassiopeia constellation, and the remnant stretches for 10 light-years. Insights from Cas A, as the remnant is also known, allow scientists to learn more about how stellar explosions occur.  Astronomers turned the Webb telescope and its instruments in the direction of Cas A to see if the observatory's infrared capabilities could pick up anything other telescopes have missed. Infrared light is invisible to the human eye, allowing Webb to spy otherwise invisible aspects of the universe. \"Cas A represents our best opportunity to look at the debris field of an exploded star and run a kind of stellar autopsy to understand what type of star was there beforehand and how that star exploded,\" said Danny Milisavljevic, assistant professor at Purdue University and principal investigator of the Webb program that captured the new observations, in a statement. \"Compared to previous infrared images, we see incredible detail that we haven't been able to access before,\" said co-investigator Tea Temim, research astronomer at Princeton University, in a statement. Webb's new infrared image of Cas A has been translated into visible light so the human eye can see the remnant's colors. Red and orange light on the remnant's exterior indicates warm dust, where material ejected from the star before it exploded is colliding with surrounding gas and dust. Inside the bubble-like structure of the remnant, bright pink light can be seen, along with features that resemble clumps and knots. This material came from the exploded star and includes glowing heavy elements like argon, neon and oxygen. A bright green loop along the right side of the bubble has also captured the interest of researchers. \"We've nicknamed it the Green Monster in honor of Fenway Park in Boston. If you look closely, you'll notice that it's pockmarked with what look like mini-bubbles,\" said Milisavljevic. \"The shape and complexity are unexpected and challenging to understand.\" The team is still trying to understand the sources behind all of the different colors in the image. Studying remnants like Cas A can help scientists understand cosmic dust, a building block for stars and planets, and how exploded stars release elements crucial for life. \"By understanding the process of exploding stars, we're reading our own origin story,\" Milisavljevic said. \"I'm going to spend the rest of my career trying to understand what's in this data set.\"",

			"body": "As the Pentagon investigates a major leak of classified documents that recently turned up on social media sites, dozens of them remain viewable on Twitter. This type of sensitive government information can slip under the radar for weeks, analysts say, because some social networks lack policies against posting classified information. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.  (You can get \"CNN's 5 Things\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Louisville shooting A 25-year-old bank employee opened fire at his workplace in Louisville, Kentucky, Monday and livestreamed the attack that left five dead and eight others injured, authorities said. The gunman was killed by police after a shootout that wounded two officers, leaving one in critical condition. According to a source familiar with the investigation, the gunman left behind a note for his parents and a friend indicating he planned to carry out a shooting at his workplace, though it is unclear when the message was found. Monday's massacre is the 146th mass shooting so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, leaving another community in mourning while lawmakers clash over possible gun violence solutions. 2. Covid-19 President Joe Biden signed a bill Monday ending the national emergency for Covid-19 -- months before he intended for the declarations to cease. One White House official downplayed the bill, saying that \"to be clear, ending the National Emergency will not impact the planned wind-down of the Public Health Emergency on May 11\" -- which enabled the government to provide many Americans with Covid-19 tests, treatments and vaccines at no charge. \"Since Congress moved to undo the National Emergency earlier than intended, we've been working with agencies to address the impacts of ending the declaration early,\" the official said. The bill to end the national emergency cleared the Senate last month in a bipartisan 68-23 vote and passed the GOP-led House earlier this year. The White House had signaled strong opposition to the bill but said Biden would sign it if it came across his desk. 3. Fungus Almost 100 confirmed or probable cases of a rare fungal infection known as blastomycosis have been linked to a Michigan paper mill, health officials say. Blastomycosis is caused by a fungus, Blastomyces, that lives in the environment, especially in moist soil and decomposing matter like wood or leaves, according to the CDC. People can breathe in these microscopic fungal spores, and although most of them won't get sick, some will develop symptoms like a fever or cough between three weeks and three months later, the CDC says. Nineteen cases have been linked with the Billerud Paper Mill in the town of Escanaba and another 74 are probable, meaning the person has symptoms. Typically, there are only one or two cases per 100,000 people each year in states where blastomycosis is a reportable condition, the CDC said. 4. Ukraine Russia is using airstrikes and artillery to destroy the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, in what Ukraine's top land commander calls \"scorched Earth\" tactics. Meanwhile, Ukraine is working to hold back Russian forces in the region, with more than 20 attacks repelled within 24 hours, according to Ukraine's General Staff of the Armed Forces. Separately, the US State Department on Monday officially declared the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich as \"wrongfully detained\" by Russia. This designation will empower the US to explore avenues such as a prisoner swap to try to secure his release. Gershkovich was detained in late March and formally charged with espionage last Friday. 5. Dalai Lama The Dalai Lama has apologized after a video emerged showing the spiritual leader kissing a child on the lips and then asking him to \"suck my tongue\" at an event in northern India. In a statement Monday, the office for the Dalai Lama said he \"wishes to apologize to the boy and his family, as well as his many friends across the world, for the hurt his words may have caused,\" adding he \"regrets\" the incident. \"His Holiness often teases people he meets in an innocent and playful way, even in public and before cameras,\" the statement said. His apology comes after a video of the exchange, which took place in February, went viral on social media -- with many users criticizing the Dalai Lama's actions. Some of his supporters, on the other hand, argue the leader's actions have been misinterpreted under a Western lens.
