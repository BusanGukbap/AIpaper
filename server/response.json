But it could take some work to regain health coverage. \"For a lot of people, this can be a very disruptive period of time,\" said Sabrina Corlette, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. \"There is a significant time and paperwork burden being placed on families -- a lot of them very low income, a lot of them medically vulnerable.\" States are now free to terminate the Medicaid coverage of residents they deem ineligible. States had been barred from involuntarily removing anyone for the past three years as part of an early congressional Covid-19 pandemic relief package, causing enrollment in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program to balloon to more than 92 million people. Of the roughly 15 million people who could lose Medicaid coverage over the next 14 months, about 8.2 million would no longer qualify, according to a Department of Health and Human Services analysis released in August.  Some 2.7 million of these folks would qualify for enhanced federal subsidies for Affordable Care Act policies that could bring their monthly premiums to as low as $0. Another 5 million are expected to secure other coverage, mainly through employers.  Some 6.8 million people, however, will be disenrolled even though they remain eligible for Medicaid. What to consider if you lose Medicaid coverage Check out Obamacare policies: Folks who lose their Medicaid coverage can shop for health insurance plans on the Affordable Care Act exchanges.  Those whose annual incomes remain below 150% of the federal poverty level -- $20,385 for a single person and $41,625 for a family of four in 2023 -- can obtain enhanced federal assistance to lower their premiums to as little as $0 a month. That beefed-up subsidy is in place through 2025.  Many people with higher incomes can find subsidized policies for $10 or less. State Medicaid agencies are tasked with easing residents' transfer from Medicaid to the Obamacare marketplaces, but the smoothness of the process will vary greatly by state. Once someone is determined to no longer qualify for Medicaid, the agency must assess his or her eligibility for Affordable Care Act coverage and transfer the resident's information to the exchange. Some states that run their own Obamacare exchanges are taking extra steps to ensure their residents remain covered. Rhode Island, for instance, is automatically enrolling certain people in marketplace coverage. It's also paying the first two months of premiums for some residents who actively select policies. Those who lose Medicaid coverage and live in the 33 states covered by the federal marketplace, healthcare.gov, can apply for Affordable Care Act policies through a special enrollment period that runs through July 2024. State-based exchanges have their own deadlines, with some mirroring the federal exchange and others providing much shorter windows. Navigators and insurance brokers can help consumers select plans. Historically, very few people who lose Medicaid coverage wind up in Obamacare plans. About 4% of adults who were terminated from Medicaid enrolled in exchange policies in 2018, according to the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission. The coverage differs too. Those that switch to the marketplace may have to find other doctors that are in their insurers' networks and may face out-of-pocket costs. Consider job-based coverage: A number of people who are terminated from Medicaid may already be covered by their employers, particularly those who started new jobs during the pandemic. Others have the option of obtaining coverage through work, though it will almost certainly be more expensive than Medicaid since it will likely entail premiums, deductibles and copays. Workers may find they can afford coverage for themselves but not for their families. If the premiums for family policies cost more than 9.12% of household income, spouses and children may be able to get subsidized coverage on the Affordable Care Act exchanges.  Employees should contact their human resources departments to sign up. Typically, they'll have to enroll within 60 days of losing Medicaid, but those who are terminated from the program between now and July 10 will have until early September to sign up. See if you or your children remain eligible for Medicaid: Millions of Americans who still qualify for Medicaid may lose coverage for procedural reasons. For example, they may have moved so they don't receive the redetermination notices. Or they may not return the necessary paperwork to prove their eligibility.  So it's crucial that folks update their contact information with their state agencies and reply to the letters they receive about renewing their Medicaid eligibility. \"When you get that packet in the mail, respond to it promptly,\" Corlette said. Those who are dropped have 90 days to submit their renewal paperwork to their state agency, which is required to reinstate them if they are found eligible. Beyond that time period, people may reapply. In most states, your coverage can be made retroactive for up to three months if you were eligible and received Medicaid-covered services. Parents who no longer qualify and are terminated should check if their children remain eligible. As many as 6.7 million kids are at risk of losing Medicaid coverage, according to Georgetown's Center for Children and Families.  Nearly three-quarters of the children projected to be dropped will remain eligible for Medicaid or CHIP but will lose coverage mainly because of administrative issues. Black and Latino children and families are more likely to be erroneously terminated, according to the center.",

			"body": "Days after a blaze at an eastern Indiana plastics recycling plant forced evacuation orders for hundreds, officials are slated to meet Saturday to discuss when it will be safe for them to return to their homes as the fire fizzles out. The massive fire -- which began Tuesday at a recycling facility in Richmond, Indiana -- was largely reduced to hotspots and flare-ups by Thursday. People within a half-mile of the plant -- about 2,000 of Richmond's 35,000 residents -- have been under evacuation orders since the fire's first night. On Saturday, officials are scheduled to review air and water samples, the results of which will help guide the duration of the evacuation order, Richmond Mayor Dave Snow said Friday. Officials have warned that the fire site itself, at the very least, was dangerous, with the mayor urging people Friday to stay away from the property. \"Because of the nature of the fire and the material it has burned, it is expected to continue smoldering and producing smoke, soot, or burnt plastic smell for several more days,\" the city said in an online notice Thursday night. Now officials are trying to determine where contaminants can be found and how dangerous they are -- from the fire zone outward. The blaze produced columns of dark smoke that were \"definitely toxic,\" the state fire marshal said Tuesday -- smoke that forced not only the evacuation orders but also moved Richmond public school officials to cancel classes through Friday. Tim Day was among the Richmond residents who left the city after the fire started Tuesday, he told CNN affiliate WRTV, in part out of concerns for his 7-month-old daughter's safety. His home is about a mile and a half from the plant. \"I started smelling it inside the apartment, with all the door and windows closed,\" Day, who went to stay with his mother in a nearby town, told WRTV. \"It was like a burning in the nose.\"  At the fire zone's center, the chemicals hydrogen cyanide, benzene, chlorine, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, were detected, the US Environmental Protection Agency said Friday. They were not detected outside the evacuation zone, the agency said. Potentially harmful VOCs also were found in six air samples -- the agency said, without saying where the samples were taken.  Particulate matter also was found inside and outside the half-mile evacuation zone, as expected, the agency said.   Additionally, one of two air samples taken a little more than a mile from the fire site detected chrysotile asbestos in debris, an EPA official said Thursday. Also called white asbestos, chrysotile asbestos can cause cancer and is used in products from cement to plastics to textiles. How officials have been responding  Firefighters who were called to the site Tuesday first saw a fire in a semitrailer loaded with plastics. The fire then jumped to surrounding piles of recyclables before eventually reaching the facility, which was \"completely full from floor to ceiling and from wall to wall,\" Richmond Fire Chief Tim Brown said.  \"Any type of plastics that you would imagine was in this facility,\" Brown said.  The cause of the fire wasn't immediately clear. But local leaders have shared concerns since at least 2019 that the facility had hazards and building code violations, records show.  Snow, the mayor, has said the plant was a fire hazard and accused the plant's owner of ignoring a city order to clean up the property. CNN has sought comment from the plant's owner, Seth Smith. The attorney who previously represented Smith in a related lawsuit declined to comment.  Since the fire, the EPA has said that any resident who may have fire debris in their yard should not mow their lawns until officials can advise about how to clean it up. A primary health concern to residents is particulate matter, which could cause respiratory problems if inhaled, said Christine Stinson, who heads the Wayne County Health Department. N95 masks -- the type recommended to protect against Covid-19 -- could shield the particles, but people should leave the area if they see or smell smoke or experience symptoms, Stinson said.",

			"body": "Don't suck the poison from a cobra bite, avoid magic mushrooms while hiking and never try to outrun a hippo: CNN Travel is back once again with our weekly roundup of news and tips.  When beasts attack When a Zimbabwean tour guide found himself head-first down a hippo's throat, his body engulfed right to the waist, it was an all-time bad day at the office. Incredibly he survived, and here's his advice for handling hippopotamuses. Hippos are found naturally in various parts of sub-Saharan Africa, but they're an invasive species in Colombia, thanks to escapees from drug trafficker Pablo Escobar's private zoo. Seventy of these \"cocaine hippos\" are set to be relocated to Mexico and India, as part of a new $3.5 million deal.  Finally, when a South African pilot this month felt a \"cold sensation\" underneath his shirt, it turned out to be a venomous stowaway cobra. He landed the plane safely with no harm done, but the snake itself disappeared without trace. While it's at large, we also have some tips on surviving a cobra bite. For one thing, don't tie a tourniquet or try the old \"cut and suction\" method; it can lead to infection and cause more damage.  Opportunity and serendipity Adventure doesn't have an age limit. Ellie Hamby and Sandy Hazelip, two 81-year-old best friends from Texas, have just toured the world in 80 days, from the beaches of Bali to the glaciers of Antarctica. \"Getting older does give you a little bit of wisdom of making decisions,\" says Hazelip. \"For me, this was the perfect age to go.\" When Connecticut woman Eileen Monaghan's Irish cousin Nora died in 2012, she lost not only her relative but her last link to Ireland. That was until she and her husband heard some Irish voices on board a Cunard cruise ship and made a new connection with a long-lost cousin who knew Nora and the tiny Donegal village where Eileen's grandmother was born. From rediscovered connections to new friendships: Andrea Rubakovic and Hollie Savitt were in their early 20s when they were both stranded at London Heathrow due to snow. The strangers ended up sharing a luxurious hotel room near the tourist hot spot of Tower Bridge -- \"the sweetest pad,\" says Rubakovic -- and 13 years later, they're still best buds.  What to do with an abandoned Boeing A brand new Boeing 747, intended as a private VIP jet for a Saudi royal, has been stripped for parts at an Arizona airpark, having spent just 30 hours in service over 16 flights. The 747-8 variant is one of the most advanced models of the 747 ever produced -- but finding a buyer for a $95 million private, four-engine business jet ain't easy.  And over in Scotland, two lightly used Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners -- not even 10 years old -- are being disassembled at an airport outside of Glasgow. The craft, which formerly flew for Norwegian, were grounded in 2019 but fell into further disrepair when the Covid pandemic hit. The Scottish climate didn't help: \"It's cold and wet and rainy and moist,\" says an analyst at aviation analytics firm Cirium. \"Not somewhere you would plan to keep them for a long time.\" While being recycled for parts is a common afterlife for retired planes, a Boeing 737 that once flew for the now defunct Mandala Airlines has been converted into a luxury villa on a clifftop in Bali. It's currently available to rent from June 2023 onwards.  Their own private ghost village Nine Italians with links to the abandoned hamlet of San Severino in Italy's Campania region came together to buy the village's medieval district to protect it from unscrupulous investors. The group hasn't been able to get much work done since the purchase in 2008, due to a lack of resources and bureaucracy issues, but the picturesque hillside village attracts around 50,000 visitors a year.  Flora both fabulous and fearsome A rare poppy super bloom has been pulling in visitors to Lancaster, California, to see the glorious blanket of springtime color. If you're out enjoying the flora on weekend hikes or far-flung travels, our partners at CNN Underscored, a product reviews and recommendations guide owned by CNN, have put plant identification apps to the test. Here are their picks.  Note the salutary lesson in plant awareness provided by our misbehaving travelers of the week: the young male hikers who had to be saved by mountain rescue after taking magic mushrooms in the UK's Lake District.  In case you missed it America's least-visited national park is some 5,000 miles from the US mainland.  And the most-visited might just be America's greatest drive-through.  Saudi Arabia has built a high-speed railway across the desert.  The super-fast trains reach speeds of up to 300 kph.  Jet lag hits differently depending on your direction of travel.  Here are six tips to get over it. ",

			"body": "A 50-year-old Spanish extreme athlete emerged on Friday from a 500-day challenge living 70 meters (230 feet) deep in a cave outside Granada with minimal contact outside. Wearing dark glasses and smiling as she adjusted to the light of spring in southern Spain, elite mountaineer Beatriz Flamini told reporters that time had flown by and she did not want to come out. \"When they came in to get me, I was asleep. I thought something had happened. I said: 'Already? Surely not.' I hadn't finished my book,\" she said. Flamini's support team said she broke a world record for the longest time spent in a cave in an experiment monitored by scientists studying the human mind and circadian rhythms. She was 48 when she went into the cave, celebrating two birthdays alone underground. Flamini began her challenge on Saturday, Nov 20, 2021 -- before the outbreak of the Ukraine war, the end of Spain's Covid mask requirement and the death of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II. She did come out for eight days, her team disclosed, but stayed isolated in a tent waiting for repairs to a router used to send audios and videos to tell her team how she was doing. On Friday, she was greeted by a phalanx of cameras and her support team who encircled her in a hug. Asked if she ever thought about pressing her panic button or leaving the cave, she replied: \"Never. In fact I didn't want to come out.\" Knitting and reading Flamini spent her time underground doing exercises, painting and drawing and knitting woolly hats. She took two GoPro cameras to document her time, and got through 60 books and 1,000 litres of water, according to her support team. She said she began her challenge trying to keep track of time. \"On day 65 I stopped counting and lost perception of time,\" she said. There were hard moments -- such as when the cave was invaded by flies -- and some \"beautiful ones\", she said. \"If this is your dream, and you're realizing it, why are you going to cry?\" She said she had focused on retaining \"coherence\", eating well and relishing the silence. She looked forward to treats such as avocados, fresh eggs and clean t-shirts that her support team sent down before, \"like gods\", also removing her waste. \"I didn't talk to myself out loud, but I had internal conversations and got on very well with myself,\" she joked. \"You have to remain conscious of your feelings. If you're afraid, that's something natural but never let panic in or you get paralyzed.\" She said her team had been told to contact her under no circumstances, even about a family death. \"If it's no communication it's no communication regardless of the circumstances. The people who know me knew and respected that.\" Flamini was monitored by a group of psychologists, researchers, cave specialists and physical trainers looking for insight into how social isolation and disorientation can affect time, brain patterns and sleep. She was looking forward to a shower and sharing a plate of fried eggs and chips with friends. She said she would put herself in the hands of doctors to study the impact on her body and mind before planning new mountaineering and caving projects. The Guinness Book of Records website awards the \"longest time survived trapped underground\" to 33 Chilean and Bolivian miners who spent 69 days at a depth of 688 meters (2,257 ft) trapped in 2010. A spokesperson for Guinness was not able to immediately confirm whether there was a separate record for voluntary time living in a cave and whether Flamini had broken it.",

Images of the leaked classified US documents that led to the arrest of an Air National Guard member this week were posted to at least two chatrooms on the Discord social media platform, according to a CNN review of Discord posts and interviews with its users.\u00a0 The leaks began months ago on the first chatroom, called \"Thug Shaker Central,\" that Teixeira allegedly oversaw, multiple US officials told CNN. An FBI affidavit unsealed Friday corroborates this timeline. It is unclear how, exactly, photos of the classified documents later ended up on a second Discord chatroom,\u00a0known as\u00a0\"End of Wow Mao Zone,\" in\u00a0March. But four members of Wow Mao Zone told CNN they saw\u00a0another user, who went by \u201cLucca\u201d and does not appear to be Teixeira, repost some of the classified documents to that chatroom.\u00a0\u00a0 CNN has been unable to contact Lucca or establish\u00a0their identity. End of Wow Mao Zone members were reluctant to identify themselves beyond screen names. Why the docs matters for the war in Ukraine: The documents\u00a0included a wide range of highly classified information, including eavesdropping on key allies and adversaries, and blunt assessments on the state of the Ukraine war. One document reveals that the US has been spying on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. That is unsurprising, said a source close to Zelensky, but Ukrainian officials are deeply frustrated about the leak. More background: The second user tied to the spread of classified documents, Lucca, had stature and anonymity on Discord \u2014 two things that allowed the documents to remain on the platform for weeks without repercussions. And multiple users assumed the documents were fake, thinking no one would be brazen enough to post US military secrets to the platform. Lucca was a \"respected user,\" one Discord user told CNN in a text conversation, and it was expected that Lucca would take the images down.\u00a0But they didn't. Many of the chat rooms are very lightly moderated, and the images stayed up for weeks, according to the four users who spoke to CNN.\u00a0 After posting the documents, Lucca would add \"fresh off the press\" or something along those lines, one user added. \"He would post them for attention. It was very common for him to ping everyone,\" the user said. What Discord says: Discord is aware of Teixeira\u2019s arrest and has cooperated with US law enforcement on the investigation, a spokesperson told CNN in a statement\u00a0Thursday night. \u201cOur\u00a0Terms of Service\u00a0expressly prohibit using Discord for illegal or criminal purposes, which includes the sharing of documents on Discord that may be verifiably classified,\u201d the spokesperson said. A Russian attack on an eastern Ukrainian city left at least eight people dead as the missiles hit residential areas and \"ordinary civilian buildings,\u201d according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The man accused of leaking\u00a0classified US intelligence documents was formally charged in Boston. Meantime, Ukraine's prime minister declined to say anything about the documents as he met with US officials in Washington, DC, but emphasized the countries are united. Here are the top headlines to know: Deadly missile strikes: At least eight people were killed and 21 injured in Russian missile strikes in the eastern city of Sloviansk, officials said. The head of the\u00a0Sloviansk city military administration said the attack was \"one of the most massive since the beginning of the year.\" Zelensky said people are under the rubble and rescue operations are still ongoing.\nPutin's new system: President Vladimir Putin signed a law creating an\u00a0electronic conscription registry\u00a0that aims to make draft dodging harder in Russia. The new system will deliver military call-up papers to a state government portal. Previously, draft letters were only considered valid when physically presented and signed for. The move spurred fears\u00a0that more citizens may soon be mobilized to fight in Ukraine.\nClassified documents leak: Jack Teixeira\u00a0was formally charged\u00a0Friday in the leak\u00a0of classified US intelligence documents posted on social media. The documents detailed eavesdropping on key allies and adversaries and blunt assessments on the state of the Ukraine war. Russia said it is analyzing leaked US classified documents and said the veracity of the information is questionable, according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.\nWeapons to Ukraine: Ukrainian soldiers have finished their training on the Danish-donated CAESAR artillery system. The equipment is expected to arrive in Ukraine \"in the coming weeks,\" Denmark\u2019s defense ministry said.\nRebuilding Ukraine: The International Monetary Fund's managing director said Friday that the global economy can continue to afford the cost of Ukraine's recovery from the Russian invasion. He called it a \u201cmiracle\u201d that Ukraine now has \u201cpredictable financing,\u201d including a recently approved $15.6 billion IMF support program to be doled out over the next four years.\nDetained American journalist: The Russians have not said what they want in exchange for Evan Gershkovich's release, said Roger Carstens, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs. He also said he has talked to the sister of Paul Whelan, another detained American, who has expressed her frustration. Gershkovich's family\u00a0spoke out\u00a0for the first time since his detention, saying the journalist felt it was his duty to report in Russia ##Catch Up## Russia has not indicated what it would want in exchange for the release of detained Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, said Roger Carstens, special presidential envoy for hostage affairs. The US has officially designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained.  \u201cThere are negotiations I\u2019ve had in the past, not with the Russians, where the other side has actually, through secret channels, said, \u2018we\u2019re doing something and by the way here\u2019s what we want to get out of this.\u2019 In this case, there have been no discussions of that sort and we don\u2019t yet know,\u201d Carstens said. The envoy said it was \u201cin a way too early\u201d to speak on negotiations about Gershkovich\u2019s release.\u00a0 \u201cIn our mind, we\u2019ve mapped out where we think we might want to go, but a lot of it\u2019s going to be based on whether we can get him out before that,\u201d Carstens said, adding the US would continue to press the Russians on the reporter\u2019s innocence. Carstens said he met with Gershkovich\u2019s family on Thursday, describing them as \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cresilient.\u201d Asked about\u00a0frustration\u00a0from Paul Whelan\u2019s sister at her brother\u2019s continued detention, Carstens noted he had been talking with Elizabeth Whelan for years and reiterated that he also spoke with Paul Whelan earlier this week. \u201cWe\u2019re not taking our foot off the gas. We\u2019re going to find a way to bring Paul and Evan home,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re front and center in our mind. We are going to find a way to get this done.\u201d Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal on Friday declined to say if he had discussed the mass leak of classified documents in meetings with US officials in Washington this week \u2013but emphasized that the two countries are united. Shmyhal also did not respond to a question from CNN if any US officials had apologized about the leak of the documents, many of which concern the war in Ukraine.\u00a0 \u201cWe discussed many very important questions and challenges and issues with all officials with whom we have meetings during this three days,\u201d he said at a press conference at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington. In his meeting with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Shmyhal said that they discussed \u201cmany very important strategic issues.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWe are crucially united and absolutely united with Americans and other international partners in preparation of our counteroffensive and we are sure that we will win this war. We will liberate our territories,\u201d he said. He elaborated that Ukraine and the US are united on issues such as training soldiers, ammunition and weapons supplies, including long-range missiles. Shmyhal suggested without evidence that the leak of the documents was tied to Russia, but said, \u201cI'm sure that the investigation will demonstrate all the conclusions.\u201d The documents: Some of the leaked documents divulged key weaknesses in Ukrainian weaponry, air defense, and battalion sizes and readiness at a critical point in the war just as the US and Ukraine have begun to develop a more mutually trusting relationship over intelligence-sharing. One document reveals that the US has been spying on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. That is unsurprising, said a source close to Zelensky, but Ukrainian officials are deeply frustrated about the leak. President Vladimir Putin signed a law Friday creating an electronic conscription registry that aims to make draft dodging harder in Russia. The new system will deliver military call-up papers to a state government portal called GosUslugi. Once the summons appears in the portal, it will be considered delivered. Previously, draft letters were only considered valid when physically presented and signed for. The law also allows for any draftee ignoring an online summons to be legally declared a fugitive after a week, banned from leaving Russia and have their assets frozen. During Russia\u2019s partial mobilization last September, men dodged the draft by leaving their registered addresses, not signing for draft letters and warning their family and coworkers from doing the same for them. Fears of a new draft: When the Russian parliament approved the law making the country's conscription program more efficient and harder to evade on Wednesday, it spurred fears that more citizens may soon be mobilized to fight in Ukraine. The Kremlin, meanwhile, characterized the law as an unremarkable streamlining of Russia\u2019s biannual conscription process. But CNN spoke to a number of Russians who dismiss the Kremlin\u2019s reassurances, and say the move lays the groundwork for another attempt to force Russians onto the battlefields in Ukraine. \u201cI don\u2019t believe a word of this,\u201d Alexey, a 41-year-old lawyer from Moscow, told CNN. While he is not within the official age range for mobilization, he does not expect the Kremlin to stick to its own guidelines when calling up recruits. \u201cNow it will be much easier to mobilize me, given how digitalized life in Moscow has become.\" \u201cThis may well be an attempt to avoid the full-scale manhunt they employed before, which caused so much panic,\u201d said a 25-year-old Russian named Artem. He dodged the September mobilization despite receiving a call-up. You can read more here. Ukrainian authorities have updated the death toll for Russian missile strikes in the eastern city of Sloviansk, with the head of the Donetsk region military administration saying eight people were killed and 21 injured. At least seven locations were hit by S-300 surface-to-air missiles, which Russia has often used to hit ground targets, Pavlo Kyrylenko told Ukrainian national television.\u00a0\u00a0 \"It is confirmed that seven S-300 missiles were launched on the multi-apartment buildings,\" he said. \"A little boy was pulled out of rubble in front of my eyes, while he was still alive,\" Kyrylenko said. \"Unfortunately, he died in the ambulance.\"\u00a0\u00a0 \"Today's attack on Sloviansk was one of the most massive since the beginning of this year,\" the head of the Sloviansk city military administration, Vadym Liakh, said. \"There were several strikes on different districts of the city.\" The missiles hit residential areas and \"ordinary civilian buildings,\u201d according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. \"People are under the rubble. Everything is done to save them, everything is done to save the wounded,\" Zelensky said in his nightly address. The president said on his official Telegram that the attack is just another example of Russia's brutality during its invasion.  \"The evil state once again demonstrates its essence. Just killing people in broad daylight. Ruining, destroying all life,\" Zelensky wrote. \"There will be fair accountability for every manifestation of terrorism. We will not leave a single trace of Russia on our land. And we will not leave any enemy unpunished either.\" Rescue operations in the areas hit are still ongoing.\u00a0 Kyrylenko said these incidents were not uncommon, calling on civilians to evacuate to parts of the country further away from the front line.\u00a0 \"The evacuation is provided; the place for temporary location is provided,\" he added. According to Kyrylenko, Kramatorsk was also hit by an S-300 missile, and Kostianynivka was struck by multiple launch rocket system artillery. Ukrainian soldiers have finished their training on the Danish-donated CAESAR artillery system, and the equipment is expected to arrive in Ukraine \"in the coming weeks,\" Denmark\u2019s defense ministry said in a statement on Friday.\u00a0 \u201cEducation and training\u00a0[on the CAESAR system]\u00a0has now been completed and the Ukrainians are ready to put the system into use,\u201d according to the ministry statement. Denmark had announced it would donate all of its 19 French-produced CAESAR artillery systems to Ukraine earlier in the year.\u00a0 \u201cThis is a newly developed artillery system which was still being implemented in the Danish defence,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe artillery system is expected to be delivered to Ukraine in the coming weeks.\u201d The\u00a0suspect in the leak\u00a0of classified US intelligence documents posted on social media was formally charged Friday during his first appearance in federal court in Boston. The FBI arrested Jack Teixeira, a 21-year-old member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard,\u00a0Thursday in North Dighton, Massachusetts. He faces two charges: Unauthorized retention and transmission of national defense information\nUnauthorized removal of classified information and defense materials An affidavit revealed new details about Teixeira's case, including that investigators suspect him of leaking information as early as December 2022. A member of his online chat group told the FBI Teixeira was scared to copy documents at work so he took them home to photograph, according to the court documents. The affidavit also revealed a US government agency's claim that Teixeira used his government computer to search for the word \"leak\" in classified intelligence reporting, and that he used his real home address to register for the social media platform where he allegedly shared the classified documents. Why it matters for the war in Ukraine: The documents\u00a0included a wide range of highly classified information, including eavesdropping on key allies and adversaries and blunt assessments on the state of the Ukraine war. Follow live updates\u00a0on the story here. The sister of Paul Whelan, who is wrongfully detained in Russia, on Thursday called on the White House to bring her brother home. \u201cPaul Whelan deserves better than he is getting for results. He has the White House attention to his case and now he needs the White House to get the job done,\u201d Elizabeth Whelan said in a\u00a0video\u00a0posted to Facebook. Paul Whelan has been detained in Russia for more than four years on espionage charges, for which he was sentenced to 16 years in prison in June 2020. The US government was unable to secure his release last year when it brought home Trevor Reed in April and Brittney Griner in December. Paul Whelan is now one of two Americans who have been designated as wrongfully detained by Russia following the arrest of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. David Whelan said earlier this week that his brother expressed concern to their parents about being left behind again. In her video, Elizabeth Whelan echoed those concerns, noting that her family has \"repeatedly seen the US government talk about lines beyond which they will not go to bring Paul Whelan back to Michigan.\" \"First it was trades. Then it was trades for certain people,\" Elizabeth Whelan said, adding that lines had been \"erased\" to bring Reed and Griner home.\u00a0 US officials have said that Russia refused to negotiate a trade for Paul Whelan when they brought home Brittney Griner. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said that the US has put forward a \"serious proposal\" to secure Paul Whelan\u2019s release.\u00a0 Elizabeth Whelan expressed frustration that it seemed \"the US government will not act with speed until there is sufficient public pressure, at which time they give the Russians whatever they want, always accepting the Russian position that Paul Whelan can\u2019t be part of the trade for some made-up Russian reason.\" \"We need the White House to take charge and get the upper hand with the likes of the Kremlin,\" Elizabeth Whelan said. \"As far as I can tell, there is no creative strategy to get Paul Whelan home,\" she added.\u00a0 Over a dozen Russian diplomats expelled by Norway on Thursday were working for Russian intelligence agencies \u2014 the Chief Intelligence Office (GRU), Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) or Federal Security Service (FSB) \u2014 the Norwegian Police Security Service said Friday.  \"We are certain these individuals are what we call intelligence officers under diplomatic cover,\" Inger Haugland, counterintelligence chief of the Norwegian Police Security Service, said at a news conference in Oslo. Risk posed by Russian intelligence in Norway has been reduced following this decision, yet it\u2019s unlikely that Russia will cease its espionage operations in the country, Haugland said. \"It is important to say that Russian intelligence services will continue to operate in Norway. Norway is important to Russia, and the intelligence services will continue to have assignments in Norway,\" she said. The move comes in response to an increasing intelligence threat from Moscow and a \"deteriorating security situation\" in Europe, according to the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  It said it had been monitoring the 15 embassy workers and have found them to be \"engaging in activities that are not compatible with their diplomatic status.\" They've been declared to be personae non gratae, stripped of diplomatic immunity, and must leave the country \"shortly,\" the ministry said in a statement.\u00a0\u00a0 Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, said in a tweet on Friday that Kyiv will \"test and use\" any non-banned weapons to retake Crimea. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly said since Russia's full-scale invasion that Ukraine plans to retake Crimea.  Crimea was declared annexed by Russia in 2014. After the revolt that forced pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych from office, Russian troops poured into the Crimean peninsula. Russia's Spetsnaz special forces have been gutted by President\u00a0Vladimir\u00a0Putin's war on Ukraine, the\u00a0The Washington Post reported Friday,\u00a0citing\u00a0more\u00a0classified US intelligence documents leaked online. CNN has not reviewed the documents and cannot verify\u00a0the content.\u00a0\u00a0 The Washington Post reports that the documents \u2013 obtained through the Discord social media platform \u2014 reference intelligence intercepts, which assess that the 346th Spetsnaz Brigade has lost almost its entire unit with \"only 125 personnel active out of 900 deployed.\" US officials believe that the large numbers of casualties that Russia has sustained will have a dramatic effect in Ukraine and anywhere else its forces are operating.\u00a0And US officials believe the highly trained forces will need up to a decade to be replenished, the Post reports.\u00a0 It also published satellite imagery from the leaked documents that \u2014 although not conclusive \u2014 suggest a depletion of vehicles among the 22nd Separate Spetsnaz Brigade\u2019s motor pool in southwestern\u00a0Russia. The images show a contrast in the size of its motor pool between November 2021 and November 2022; the later date, the Post reports, shows the force following its return from Ukraine last summer.\u00a0 CNN has contacted the Pentagon for comment. CNN has also contacted the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment. According to Ukrainian officials, Russian special forces are currently deployed in the eastern city of Bakhmut, where\u00a0the fiercest and heaviest fighting is currently being waged. Ukraine\u2019s Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said Thursday that \"despite the fact that the enemy has concentrated its most professional units in Bakhmut, including Wagner fighters, airborne assault units, and special forces, the Russians cannot achieve their goals there.\"\u00a0 Some key background: Russian special forces were poorly deployed early in the invasion, especially around Kyiv, and took heavy losses. In the early days of the war, CNN's Matthew Chance reported live as Russian Airborne Forces (VDV) engaged in a firefight with Ukrainian forces at Antonov Airport in Hostomel, a suburb of Kyiv, before they were heavily defeated and retreated by the beginning of April.\u00a0 CNN has previously reported how the Russian invasion has also been marked by an inordinate number of casualties among high-ranking Russian officers. In the first months of this year,\u00a0CNN also reported\u00a0how Russian forces were badly hit in the hotly contested town of Vuhledar in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, where the 155th Marine Brigade were prominently involved.\u00a0At least two dozen Russian tanks and infantry vehicles were disabled or destroyed in a matter of days, according to videos, which were released by the Ukrainian military and analyzed by CNN and military experts.\u00a0\u00a0 The perpetrators of the beheading of a Ukrainian soldier seen in a video released on social media earlier this week must be held accountable, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said in a phone call with Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky Friday. \u201cDiscussing the abhorrent beheading of a Ukrainian soldier shown on social media in recent days, the Prime Minister said the video was appalling and those responsible had to be held to account,\u201d Downing Street said in a statement. Sunak also stressed the importance of continued Western support for Ukraine, including information exchange between NATO and Kyiv. The two leaders agreed to stay in touch. Zelensky tweeted following the phone call, saying that the leaders spoke about the execution as well as the situation at the front line and defense support. The family of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich\u00a0has spoken out\u00a0for the first time since his detention in Moscow on spying charges, saying the journalist was passionate about showing people other sides of Russia and felt it was his duty to report there. Here are other headlines you may have missed: Leaked Pentagon documents: Russia is analyzing leaked US classified documents and say the veracity of the information is questionable, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday. The detention of a member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard, Jack Teixeira, in connection with the leaked documents, is the \u201cprerogative of the US special services,\u201d he said. \nLeak suspect will appear in court: Teixeira, who was\u00a0arrested by the FBI\u00a0on Thursday in connection with the\u00a0leaking of classified documents\u00a0that have been posted online,\u00a0will first appear in court on Friday in Boston, according to the US attorney\u2019s office there.\nMedia restrictions and fines: The Russian ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, has signaled a possible reduction in the number of American journalists working in Russia, amid tensions with Washington over the arrest of Gershkovich, classified by the US as wrongly detained. Meanwhile, a Moscow court has fined the Wikimedia Foundation, which owns Russian-language Wikipedia, 2 million rubles ($24,500) for failure to remove an article about the \"Russian occupation of the Zaporizhzhia region,\" according Russian state media.\nRussian naval drills: Russia has placed its Pacific naval fleet on high alert as part of spot drills aimed at assessing and improving its state of readiness, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced Friday. This comes after Russia\u2019s Pacific Fleet press service said on Thursday morning warships from the\u00a0fleet conducted anti-submarine exercises\u00a0in waters off the country\u2019s far eastern coast.\nFinnish embassy receives letters containing white powder: Finland\u2019s embassy in Moscow has alerted Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry after it received a delivery of three letters on Thursday, one discovered upon opening to contain white powder, Russian state media RIA Novosti reported Friday. The letters have been handed over to Russian representatives. ##Catch Up## Russia is analyzing leaked US classified documents and say the veracity of the information is questionable, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday during a media conference call.  The detention of a member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard, Jack Teixeira, in connection with the leaked documents, is the \u201cprerogative of the US special services,\u201d he said.  \u201cOur focus is to thoroughly examine this data, while also critically assessing its authenticity, but to study it meticulously.\u201d Peskov said the responsibility of examining the data falls within the purview of the Russian special service when asked if any of the information could threaten Russia\u2019s security. Some background:\u00a0Teixeira, 21, was\u00a0arrested by the FBI\u00a0on Thursday in connection with the\u00a0leaking of classified documents\u00a0that have been posted online, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced Thursday. His arrest came following a fast-moving search by the US government for the identity of the leaker who posted classified documents to a social media platform popular with video gamers.  Teixeira was arrested in Massachusetts without incident, Garland said, and will be arraigned in federal court there. \u201cThis investigation is ongoing. We will share more information at the appropriate time,\u201d the attorney general said, declining to answer questions. Teixeira will first appear in court on Friday in Boston, according to the US attorney\u2019s office there. The family of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who the US State Department classifies as wrongly detained by Russia, have spoken out for the first time in an exclusive video interview with the newspaper. WSJ reporter Shelby Holliday asked the journalist's father, Mikhail, if the pair ever talked about what could happen to him as a journalist in Russia. Mikhail said \"no\" but said he trusted his son and his judgement. \"Of course, it makes things more difficult for me now. [Because] I feel I've failed in some way as a father,\" he added. Following Gershkovich's detention on March 29, his mother Ella Milman, who left the Soviet Union for the United States in 1979, said she had a sixth sense that something had happened to him. His sister Danielle spoke of how her parents, who emigrated from the Soviet Union separately but in the same year, raised her and Evan to have pride in where they came from. She said she was \"in awe of him\" when reading about Russia through his reporting Danielle noted that her and her brother are \"so different. I'm a home body. He's a thrill seeker, an adventure. I can't even relate to him sometimes in the life he leads, as a reporter. \"I think... America reports on Russia sometimes in a way that makes it seem like a pretty terrifying cold place, he was really passionate about showing other sides\u2026 the nuance and the beauty of it,\" Danielle said. His parents told the WSJ he \"loved having fun' from an early age and was always very curious. His mother said he had \"so many friends\" and they saw Russia through his eyes, and it was \"beautiful\". The reporter began his role at the WSJ a month before the Russian invasion in Ukraine began in February last year. \"He said that I'm one of the few left there, I know that he felt like it was his duty to report there,\" his mother recalled. \"When we came to visit him in 2018, I said to him that this is the country that I left and this is the country that you love and he said, 'what an interesting thought',\" she added. His dad said he \"couldn't have stopped him\" from going to Russia. His sister said she hopes he's writing in prison and she's hoping he \"can make friends\" in there. She said seeing the publicity his case is getting is \"strangely helpful for me\" and as a family \"they will do whatever it takes\" to free him. \"It's one of the American qualities that we absorbed, be optimistic, believe in\u2026 happy ending. That's where we stand right now. But I am not stupid. I understand what's involved, but that's what I choose to believe,\" his mother Ella concluded. Some background: Gershkovich was detained last month by Russian authorities who accused him of spying, ratcheting up tensions between Russia and the US. Gershkovich\u2019s arrest marks the first time an American journalist has been detained on accusations by Moscow of spying since the Cold War. Finland\u2019s embassy in Moscow has alerted Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry after it received a delivery of three letters on Thursday, one discovered upon opening to contain white powder, Russian state media RIA Novosti reported on Friday. An embassy statement obtained by RIA says \u201cthree letters were delivered to the Embassy of Finland in the Russian Federation, when opening the first of which a powder was found\u201d. The letters were handed over to Russian representatives, and the Finnish embassy alerted Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the statement added. Relations between Helsinki and Moscow are tense with Finland\u2019s recent ascension to NATO.  CNN has reached out to the Finnish embassy in Moscow for more details. Russia has placed its Pacific naval fleet on high alert as part of spot drills aimed at assessing and improving its state of readiness, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced Friday. \"At 09:00 (Vladivostok time) today, Pacific Fleet was assembled by alarm in its full complement and began to be put on the highest degree of combat alert,\" Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu told a Ministry of Defense leadership conference, according to a statement. \u00a0 \"As part of the event, the Pacific Fleet is to repel massive missile and aviation strikes, practice submarine search and destruction, complete torpedo and artillery fire drills and missile launches to defeat the warship strike groups and ground activities of a mock adversary,\" Shoigu continued. This comes after Russia\u2019s Pacific Fleet press service said on Thursday morning warships from the Pacific Fleet conducted anti-submarine exercises in waters off the country\u2019s far eastern coast.

According to TASS, a Moscow court found the Wikimedia Foundation guilty of not removing information from its web page and fined it 2 million rubles ($24,500). The court documents state that Wikipedia refused to remove an [article] about hostilities within the framework of the special military operation and Russia\u2019s annexation of the Zaporizhzhia region, TASS reports. There have been debates about banning Wikipedia in Russia. Asked about the possibility of shutting the website down, the Kremlin said last Tuesday that a Russian alternative to the Wikipedia platform needs to be developed first. Russia needs its own equivalent of the online encyclopedia due to the Kremlin\u2019s concerns about its \u201cinaccuracies, distortions,\u201d and \u201chistorical and factual errors\u201d on Wikipedia, according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. The Russian ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, has signaled a possible reduction in the number of American journalists working in Russia. Talking about US-Russia relations on state TV Thursday, Antonov said Russia feels the growing pressure on its embassy and bilateral relations overall after its arrest of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. Antonov said he had a \u201cvery harsh\u201d conversation with US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland, during which the State Department accused Moscow of unlawfully detaining Gershkovich. \u201cThe Americans threatened us with retaliatory measures if we did not release Gershkovich in the near future. Let's see how they will act,\u201d Antonov said in an interview with Russia\u2019s Channel One. He added that this meeting had \u201cno practical outcome.\u201d Antonov also noted that Russian journalists have faced unfavorable treatment in the US and pointed out that the number of American reporters working in Russia far exceeds the number of Russian reporters working in the US. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time for us to show reciprocity and reduce the number of American journalists who work in Moscow, Russia as a whole, to the number that works in Washington and New York?\u201d he asked. Some background: Gershkovich was last month detained by Russian authorities who accused him of spying, ratcheting up tensions between Russia and the US. Gershkovich\u2019s arrest marks the first time an American journalist has been detained on accusations by Moscow of spying since the Cold War, and the US State Department on Monday officially designated the Wall Street Journal reporter\u00a0as wrongfully detained by Russia. During a joint press conference in Beijing, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told her Chinese counterpart Qin Gang that China should exert influence on Russia to end the war in Ukraine, and said that unilateral change of the status quo over the Taiwan Strait by means of force is unacceptable.\u00a0 Baerbock said Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s recent visit to Moscow, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, clearly indicates that no country has bigger influence over Russia than China.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn the same fashion as how China mediated between Iran and Saudi Arabia, we want China to use that influence to urge Russia to end its war in Ukraine,\u201d Baerbock stated.\u00a0 Baerbock is on her maiden visit to China from Thursday to Saturday.\u00a0 On Taiwan: Baerbock also stated that destabilization of the Taiwan Strait would have terrible consequences for the global economy, and that Germany is concerned about the rising tensions over the Taiwan Strait.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMilitary conflicts over the Taiwan Strait would be a horrible scenario and one that is unacceptable to Europe.\u00a0\u00a0We call on all parties to not escalate tensions in the region, and we will do everything we can to maintain peace and stability in the region,\u201d Baerbock said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWe will continue to uphold the one China policy, but differences must be resolved through peaceful means.\u00a0\u00a0Europe will not accept unilateral change of status quo through the use of force,\u201d Baerbock added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In response, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang reiterated Beijing\u2019s position of promoting peace talks and not providing lethal and dual-use weapons to all relevant parties in the Ukraine war.\u00a0 Qin said, \u201cTaiwan independence and peace cannot coexist together,\u201d and added that \u201cif a country says it respects the one China principle, it should resolutely oppose Taiwan independence.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Qin also called for cooperation and not competition between China and Germany.\u00a0 Some context: Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, there's worry that\u00a0China\u00a0may one day treat\u00a0Taiwan\u00a0in the same way. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party has never controlled Taiwan but claims the self-ruled island democracy as its own and has repeatedly refused to rule out taking it by force. Since the war in Ukraine, the European Union has taken a harsh stance against Russia and its close ally, China, as their military and trade relations run deep. It will be \u201cextremely difficult\u201d for the European Union (EU) to \u201cmaintain a relationship of trust with China\u201d if Beijing does not help search for a political solution to end Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the bloc\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said Friday.\u00a0 \u201cI would like to say this in all friendship: it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the European Union to maintain a relationship of trust with China\u2026 if China does not contribute to the search for a political solution based on Russia's withdrawal from the Ukrainian territory,\u201d Borrell said in published remarks he was due to deliver during a visit to Beijing which was canceled after he tested positive for Covid-19.\u00a0 The EU's top diplomat had to postpone a trip to China this week after he tested positive for the coronavirus, according to a tweet he posted. \u201cNeutrality in the face of the violation of international law is not credible. We do not ask anyone to align with our own position. We simply ask to admit and recognize that in this case there was a serious violation of international law,\u201d the statement added.\u00a0 Borrell also called on Chinese President Xi Jinping to speak to Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky and \u201cprovide more substantial humanitarian aid to the battered Ukrainian people.\u201d\u00a0 EU-China relationship: Borrell said relations between the EU and China \u201chave deteriorated in recent years due to a growing number of irritants,\u201d in particular China\u2019s position on the war in Ukraine and EU sanctions against Chinese officials over the reported mass detention and persecution of Uyghurs in Xinjiang.\u00a0 \u201cAt the same time, we have remained committed to engagement and cooperation and recognize China's crucial role in solving global and regional problems. We do not fear China's rise. However, we know that the history of tomorrow's world will also depend on how China uses its power,\u201d Borrell wrote.\u00a0 The ongoing trade \u201cimbalance\u201d between the EU and China was also addressed at length.\u00a0The statement said the bloc's total amount of our trade reached nearly 850 billion euros ($941 billion) in 2022, but Borrell noted that these exchanges were \"increasingly unbalanced\" at a disadvantage to the EU.  \"Our trade deficit has reached a record of 400 billion euros ($443 billion), or 2.3% of our GDP\u2026 If imbalances are not corrected, we have to react,\u201d the statement said.\u00a0 Thursday saw the arrest of a 21-year-old man in the high-profile case surrounding\u00a0leaked US intelligence documents, including ones\u00a0containing classified information\u00a0on the\u00a0war in Ukraine. Here are some of the other major storylines out of Ukraine you need to know: Shelling in southern Ukraine:\u00a0Russian shelling in the southern Kherson region\u00a0killed at least two civilians\u00a0Thursday, a regional official said, including a 45-year-old man who died in the city of Kherson and another civilian in the village of Zmiivka.\nWartime holiday:\u00a0The deadly shelling in Kherson comes as officials across the country\u00a0prepare for Orthodox Easter\u00a0this Sunday. Churches in some regions will remain closed at night for fear of Russian strikes, and officials will ban the public from certain cemeteries over concerns about unexploded mines.\nAgriculture woes:\u00a0Up to a third of Ukraine\u2019s territory\u00a0may still contain explosive devices, according to the country\u2019s emergency service. That\u2019s just one of\u00a0several factors\u00a0making this a challenging season for the country\u2019s farmers. This season\u2019s grain exports will be critical for both Ukraine\u2019s domestic needs and the\u00a0global hunger crisis.\nBiden in Ireland:\u00a0US President Joe Biden touted Western support for the defense of Ukraine during\u00a0a speech to Ireland\u2019s Parliament\u00a0Thursday,\u00a0prompting an ovation from the assembled lawmakers. He particularly praised Irish leadership on United Nations sanctions, ensuring the penalties wouldn\u2019t interfere with humanitarian efforts.\nDetained journalist:\u00a0Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry will only discuss a potential exchange for\u00a0jailed American journalist Evan Gershkovich\u00a0after his trial, according to Russian state news agency TASS. Russia accused him of spying, while the US has declared Gershkovich wrongly detained.\nBattle for Bakhmut:\u00a0The\u00a0fight grinds on\u00a0for the eastern city of Bakhmut, which has seen the conflict\u2019s most brutal fighting for weeks. Russian and Wagner mercenary forces are trying to inch closer to the city center. Both sides claim the other has suffered huge losses. ##Catch Up## Ukrainian farmers trying to sow crops this season have faced \u201cmore difficult conditions than in 2022,\u201d according to a policy official. Denys Marchuk, deputy chairman of the\u00a0Ukrainian Agrarian Council Public Union, laid out the numerous challenges facing the country\u2019s crop sowing campaign \u2014\u00a0which launched late last month \u2014 in a news conference in Kyiv on Thursday. Short on money:\u00a0Marchuk highlighted a lack of funding as a key reason why farmers are struggling to produce. Farmers have run out of supplies like mineral fertilizers, plant protection products and seed, and did not receive additional funding for 2023. Russia left large areas unusable:\u00a0Some 7 million hectares (more than 27,000 square miles) of farmland in Ukraine can\u2019t be used during the sowing campaign, according to the Ministry of Agrarian Policy. Apart from Russian-occupied territories, which are temporarily off the table,\u00a0there are still mines\u00a0that have not been removed across\u00a0a lot of liberated land in Ukraine. As CNN has previously reported, the country\u2019s farmers\u00a0face a stark choice: clear the fields of explosives to prepare for planting season or contemplate another year without income. Making the most of available land:\u00a0Despite all the challenges, Ukraine plans to sow crops on more than 19 million hectares of land (more than 73,000 square miles), according to the agrarian ministry. \u201cThis will actually give fairly good harvest rates, given the wartime conditions. In terms of harvest figures, we should be able to fully ensure food security within the country and be able to export,\u201d Marchuk said Thursday.\u00a0 Why a successful season is so important:\u00a0Ukraine is regarded as a key breadbasket for much of the world, and the country relies on agriculture to generate more than 40% of total export revenues. The country\u2019s economy shrank by more than 30% in 2022 after Russia\u2019s invasion destroyed infrastructure, hurt businesses and disrupted daily life, Kyiv\u2019s Economic Ministry said in March. The deputy chairman said farmers sold the grain group \u201cmostly either at a loss or at their cost price,\u201d saying this was a reason for the lack of free funds that could be used during this sowing campaign. \u201cOverall, the costs of the sowing campaign this season will increase by about 19%. In total, about UAH 230 billion ($6 billion) will be spent on the sowing campaign,\u201d Marchuk said. The European Union added\u00a0Russia\u2019s Wagner private military group\u00a0and Russian news agency RIA FAN to a list of organizations it is sanctioning, a statement from the European Council said Thursday. The EU sanctioned the two organizations for \u201cundermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine,\u201d the statement read.\u00a0 \u201cRussia must stop its aggression and immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces and proxies from the entire territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders,\u201d the statement read.\n\u201cThe EU stands firmly and fully with Ukraine and will continue to provide strong political, economic, military, financial and humanitarian support to Ukraine and its people for as long as it takes.\u201d Some background:\u00a0RIA FAN is part of the Patriot Media Group, a Russian organization\u00a0whose Board of Trustees is headed by\u00a0Yevgeny Prigozhin, according to the EU. Prigozhin is also the head of the Wagner Group, which has been previously sanctioned for what the EU describes as\u00a0serious human rights violations. The EU has now sanctioned a total of 1,473 individuals and 207 entities in connection with their actions in Ukraine, the statement read. Those designated are subject to an asset freeze, and EU citizens and companies are forbidden from making funds available to them, the statement read. Authorities will bolster security measures across the country as Ukrainians prepare to celebrate another Orthodox Easter while fighting Russia\u2019s war.\u00a0 Residents are discouraged from attending church services late at night this weekend, and many cemeteries will remain closed\u00a0due to the danger of unexploded mines and Russian shelling. Eastern Orthodox Christians celebrate\u00a0Palm Sunday\u00a0and Easter one week after many Christians in the US and other Western countries observe the holiday. Ukrainian officials have warned in the past that Russian attacks may increase around specific dates, holidays or events. Oleksiy Biloshytskyi, a national law enforcement official, said police will use special monitoring centers to look out for any signs of attacks. \u201cWe must remember that the enemy is insidious and can take any action even during this (Easter) night,\u201d he said. In the capital Kyiv, residents will be able to attend late evening church services despite a curfew, but they must arrive at church before the curfew takes effect, the\u00a0head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, Serhii Popko, said Thursday in a Telegram post. Popko said churchgoers and clergy should research the nearest shelter to their congregation and be prepared to flee to safety if an air raid alarm sounds. The curfew hours in Kyiv last from midnight to 5 a.m. local time (10 p.m. ET), as is the case for most of the country. In the broader Kyiv region, residents will only be able to attend church services when the curfew is not in effect, and only a limited number of people will be allowed on the grounds of churches and cemeteries due to security reasons, the\u00a0Kyiv region\u2019s military administration said Monday.\u00a0 Many churches will broadcast services online, it added. In northeastern Kharkiv,\u00a0which is Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, officials will close\u00a0a number of cemeteries. Authorities warned that one of the cemeteries, the Slobozhanskyi memorial complex, has not been fully cleared of explosive mines. Other city cemeteries will be closed on Easter \u201cto avoid provocations by the enemy and to protect citizens from unpredictable missile attacks,\u201d the city council said. In the southern city of Kherson, residents won\u2019t be able to visit cemeteries or attend church services during curfew hours, the city council said Tuesday. It said the ban on cemeteries was due to mine danger. \u201cThe enemy daily launches hostile attacks on the civilian population of the Kherson community. Unfortunately, the possibility of shelling during the holidays cannot be ruled out,\u201d the city council said.\u00a0 Russia's Prosecutor General's Office said Thursday it has launched an investigation into a video that purports to show the beheading of a captured Ukrainian solider. \u201cIn the course of monitoring the Internet, the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation has found photographic and video materials containing, presumably, scenes of the murder of an allegedly Ukrainian serviceman,\u201d an official statement reads. The statement specifies the probe is related to video of \"an unknown person in camouflage in the summer season\" that \"uses violence with a knife against an unknown serviceman, as a result of which he causes his death\". The prosecution has submitted the materials to investigating authorities for probing in order to \u201cassess the authenticity of these materials and make an appropriate decision.\u201d"

			"body": "BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm, slashed Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink's pay by 30% to $25.2 million for 2022, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The move comes after the money manager reported first-quarter revenue that was down 10% from a year ago, as rising interest\u00a0rates\u00a0and economic uncertainty impacted the firm's bottom line. \"With respect to 2022 compensation, management determined to reduce the impact of the firm\u2019s decline in profitability on BlackRock\u2019s broader employee population by concentrating the downward adjustments to total incentive awards toward senior management,\" the filing said. Total compensation for Fink, 70, included a base salary of $1.5 million and $23.7 million in total incentive awards. Several other executives saw their compensation reduced, including Rob Kapito, the firm's president, whose package shrank by 34% to $18.95 million. UBS' purchase of Credit Suisse's US subsidiaries can move forward, the Federal Reserve said Friday. The statement comes a month after UBS stepped in to rescue the embattled Swiss lender and prevent turmoil in the financial sector from spreading, after an emergency loan of nearly $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank failed to stop the carnage. The problems for Credit Suisse began when the Saudi National Bank, its largest backer, said it wouldn't put up more cash after buying a nearly 10% stake in the bank for $1.5 billion in 2022. Banking customers were already on edge after the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank \u2014 so Credit Suisse shares tumbled more than 25% and saw billions of dollars of outflows. The global turmoil has led US lawmakers to call for tighter regulations on banks. The Fed board said UBS will provide a quarterly updated plan for combining UBS's and Credit Suisse's US business and operations. \"The implementation plan will address UBS's obligations to comply with more stringent enhanced prudential standards, including liquidity standards,\" the Fed said in a statement. UBS is shelling out 3 billion Swiss francs, or $3.25 billion, for Credit Suisse. Stocks slid Friday after a slate of earnings beats from big banks fueled concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its next two meetings. Still, the major indices gained for the week. The Dow rose 400 points, or 1.2%. The S&P 500 gained 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.3%. JPMorgan Chase on Friday reported first-quarter profit and revenue that crushed expectations, boosted by the Fed's interest rate hiking campaign. Citigroup, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial also reported strong results. CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors in the company's post-earnings conference call that they should prepare for interest rates to be higher for longer than expected. Wall Street seems to have taken note. Analysts increased their bets on a quarter-point rate hike at the Fed's meeting in May and another in June. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Friday that the central bank needs to continue tightening monetary policy, further weighing down markets. Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said that it's \"definitely\" possible the United States enters a mild recession after the tumult in banking last month. Meanwhile, retail sales data declined more than expected, suggesting that Americans' spending power and the US economy are weakening. Consumer sentiment held fairly steady in April, even as concerns about a recession linger, according to the University of Michigan's latest monthly survey. \"There was too much news to digest this morning, but the key takeaway is that the Fed has room to do more harm,\" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said in a note. The Dow slipped 144 points, or 0.4%. The S&P 500 tumbled 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite sank 0.4%. As\u00a0stocks\u00a0settle\u00a0after the trading day, levels might still change slightly. Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said Friday he isn't discounting the recent assessment from central bank economists that the banking crisis will tip the United States into a mild recession later this year. \"There's no way you can look at current conditions around the world and in the US and not think that some mild recession is definitely on the table as a possibility,\" Goolsbee said Friday during an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" He added that, when viewed historically, the monetary tightening campaign undertaken by the Fed \u2014 hiking interest rates nine times in just over a year \u2014 is expected to slow GDP growth. \"When you get numbers like retail sales and others that are declining, if you look at construction, I think we've got to think about what's the state of growth in the country,\" he said. \"Fortunately, the labor market continues to be very strong.\" Critics have lambasted the World Bank and, particularly, the International Monetary Fund, for predicting Russia's economy would hold relatively stable this year despite international sanctions. But sanctions are hurting Russia's economy, even if World Bank forecasts don\u2019t reflect it, according to the outgoing World Bank President David Malpass. Speaking to Julia Chatterley at the IMF-World Bank spring conference, David Malpass responded to criticism that you couldn\u2019t trust GDP and economic data from Russia. He admitted \u201cthe quality of the data differs substantially by country\u2026the reality is there\u2019s not very much in terms of double checking of data\u201d.  In January, the IMF projected that Russia\u2019s economy would expand by 0.3% this year and 2.1% the next. That was much more optimistic than the latest forecasts from the World Bank, which still penciled in a contraction of just 3.3% this year. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development was the most pessimistic, forecasting a 5.6% contraction in Russia's economy in 2023. Malpass said that GDP numbers\u00a0were not capturing the \u201creality\u201d and \u201chorror\u201d of the war, and noted the Russian economy was suffering.  \u201cI think life is hard in Russia\u2026they\u2019re excluded from travelling to many parts of the world, their supply chains have to change dramatically\u2026 young people moving out because they don\u2019t want to be part of this war,\" Malpass said. Consumer sentiment tracked by the University of Michigan held steady in April, according to a preliminary reading released Friday. So far, the university's monthly surveys have shown a limited impact from the banking crisis on consumers' attitudes, but Americans remain concerned about an upcoming recession and some lingering fears about\u00a0inflation\u00a0persist. \"Consumers are expecting a downturn, they're not feeling as dismal as they were last summer, but they're waiting for the other shoe to drop,\" said Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Friday morning.  \"We now have about a month of data following the collapse of SVB, and there hasn't really been much of an effect on sentiment at all,\" she said.  The latest survey also showed that higher gas prices helped push up year-ahead inflation expectations by a full percentage point, rising from 3.6% in March to 4.6% in April. \"Consumers are still feeling the pain of high prices,\" Hsu told Bloomberg, noting that survey respondents were now mentioning gas prices for the first time since fall. The latest cooldown in consumer and producer price hikes as well as the latest decline in retail sales are indications that the Federal Reserve's efforts are working to bring down high inflation, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC on Friday. \"You don\u2019t want to overreact to short-run news, but it feel likes like that's moving in the right direction,\" he said during an appearance on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" Goolsbee was quick to note that an area of critical importance to him in advance of the next Fed meeting is activity in banking and credit. Earlier this week, Goolsbee noted that the Fed needs to be \"on watch\" for tighter credit conditions as a result of the banking turmoil last month. He referenced private sector analyst estimates that the spillover effects of the crisis equate to the Fed enacting rate hikes anywhere from a quarter point to three-quarters of a point. \"I'm an old-school data dog,\" Goolsbee said Friday. \"What I would do is spend the next three weeks getting out and figuring out how much credit tightening is coming.\" Chief executives at some of the largest banks in the United States were forced to address the elephant in the room as they reported first-quarter earnings on Friday morning: The regional banking crisis that brought Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank to ruin last month.  > Banking industry turmoil has added to risks of recessionary \"storm clouds\" on the horizon, said\u00a0JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Friday in a release. He added that \"the banking situation is distinct from 2008 as it has involved far fewer financial players and fewer issues that need to be resolved.\"  Still, said Dimon, who leads the country's largest bank, \"financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending.\" >\u201cWe are glad to have been in a strong position to help support the US financial system during the recent events that impacted the banking industry,\" commented Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf in a statement. \"Regional and community banks are an important part of our financial system and are uniquely positioned to serve their customers and communities.\" > \"I believe today\u2019s crisis of confidence in the regional banking sector will further accelerate capital markets growth, and BlackRock will be a central player,\" wrote BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Friday.  \"Increased financing through the capital markets will require the scale, multi-asset capabilities and excellence in portfolio construction that BlackRock consistently delivers across market cycles,\" he said in a statement.  That means bad news for regional banks could be good news for BlackRock -- the lack of trust in regional banks will drive more investment into capital markets and BlackRock is poised to benefit as that happens. \"Throughout our history, moments of market dislocation and disruption have served as inflection points for BlackRock,\" he explained.  Regulators also hired BlackRock in early April to help the US government in the sale of the $114 billion in assets it collected from the collapse> Citigroup and PNC did not address the banking crisis in their releases, but will likely answer questions about how they've weathered the turmoil and what they see ahead at their first-quarter presentations, planned for 11 a.m. ET. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors Friday not to be caught unawares if interest rates stay higher longer than expected. \"People need to be prepared. They shouldn't pray that they don't go up. They should prepare for them going up. And if it doesn't happen, serendipity,\" Dimon said on the company's post-earnings conference call. High interest rates have helped big banks, including JPMorgan Chase, since they widen the gap between the interest paid to customers and what they earn from investing that money. But climbing rates also helped drive last month's collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which held 55% of its customers deposits in long-dated bonds whose value diminished as interest rates rose. Dimon stated that he believes the banking crisis will pass \u2014 even though he expects its effects to reverberate through the sector for years to come \u2014 but that the possibility of higher interest rates should remain on companies' radars. \"If and when that happens, it will address problems in the economy. For those who are too exposed to floating rates, or those who are too exposed to [refinancing] risk, those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy,\" Dimon said. \"Now would be the time to fix it. Do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools,\" he said. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank, told investors Friday that he isn't too worried about a credit crunch resulting from the recent banking crisis.  \"I wouldn't use the word[s] 'credit crunch,'\" he said in response to a question about whether he was worried that lending would tighten in the bank after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. There will be \"a little bit of tightening,\" said Dimon, but that will mostly be contained within the real estate market.  Dimon added that he's more worried about recession than a credit crunch.  \"I just look at it as a kind of a thumb on the scale. It just makes the financing conditions a little bit tighter and increases the odds of a recession,\" he said. \"That's what that is. It's not like a credit crunch.\" JPMorgan Chase said Friday its exposure to the office sector is limited, addressing concerns about the commercial real estate industry's stability. \"Given the recent focus on commercial real estate, let me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused in urban dense markets, and nearly two-thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply-constrained markets,\" said Jeremy Barnum, chief financial officer, in the company's post-earnings conference call. Investors and regulators are watching the $20 trillion US commercial real estate market for signs that it could be the next shoe to drop after the banking tumult last month. That\u2019s partly because the value of buildings is going down, particularly as offices in major cities remain vacant or half-empty as Americans opt to work from home. The commercial real estate industry\u2019s woes come after decades of unbridled growth powered by low interest rates and easy credit. That upward trend was interrupted by the Covid pandemic\u2019s onset, and then when the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates aggressively last year to stabilize the economy. \"There are obviously some big things here and there to pay attention to, but in the scheme of things for us, not a big issue,\" Barnum said. Spending at US retailers fell in March as consumers pulled back amid recessionary fears fueled by the banking crisis. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the prior month, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. That was steeper than an expected 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv, and above the revised 0.2% decline in the prior month.\u00a0 The drop was driven by a pullback in spending at department stores and on durable goods such as appliances and furniture. Spending at general merchandise stores fell 3% in March from the prior month and spending at gas stations declined 5.5% during the same period. Excluding gas station sales, retail spending retreated 0.6% in March from February.\u00a0 However, year-on-year retail spending rose 2.9%. Citigroup shares were up about 0.8% in premarket trading after the bank posted strong first-quarter profits, beating analyst expectations for both earnings per share and revenue. The bank brought in $21.4 billion in revenue versus expectations of $19.9 billion. Earnings per share were $2.19, estimates were for $1.67.  Citi CEO Jane Fraser and CFO Mark Mason will hold an earnings presentation at 11 a.m. ET.  Stocks slid Friday, even as big banks reported beats on their first-quarter earnings in an auspicious start to earnings season. Investors were watching for clues about the financial sector's stability, and whether the tumult in the sector last month could lead to tighter lending standards. A key point of interest was also how much big banks benefitted from increased deposit inflows when nervous customers fled from regional banks after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. JPMorgan, the largest bank in the United States and an economic bellwether, posted record revenue. Wells Fargo, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services also reported earnings beats. Shares of JPMorgan Chase gained 4.8%, Wells Fargo rose 0.7%, Citigroup added 1.9% and PNC Financial Services ticked up 0.3%. Meanwhile, retail sales came in weaker than expected as recession fears loom. Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not for inflation, fell by 1% in March from the month before, according to the Commerce Department. Economists expected a 0.4% decline, according to Refinitiv. The Dow fell 38 points, or about 0.1%. The S&P 500 sank 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.5%. The Federal Reserve could end its historic rate-hiking campaign after just one more quarter-point increase, said Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic in a Thursday interview with Reuters. The Fed has approved nine rate hikes in a row since last March, the effects of which are only now starting to \u201cbite,\u201d Bostic said. Monetary policy can take months to trickle through the economy, but a slew of recent data suggests that inflation is finally cooling. The March Consumer Price Index shows price hikes have slowed for nine months in a row, and headline wholesale inflation reflected in the Producer Price Index has sunk to 2.7% after reaching double digit highs last year. Bostic said the recent \"chaos\" in the banking sector, after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, persuaded him to rethink the pace of rate hikes. However, he told Reuters he believes the turmoil will not have any lasting impact on the the US economy. Analysts expect the Fed to raise rates by a quarter point at its upcoming policy meeting on May 2-3, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Regional bank PNC Financial reported first-quarter revenue of $5.6 billion and earnings per share of $3.98 vs. expectations of $3.66. Shares rose 5% on the news. Wells Fargo reported first-quarter revenue of $20.7 billion against expectations of $20.1 billion. The San Francisco-based bank saw earnings of $4.9 billion, up from $3.8\u00a0billion\u00a0a year earlier, an increase of about 32%. Shares of Wells Fargo rose 2.2%. JPMorgan Chase on Friday reported first-quarter profit and revenue that roundly beat expectations, boosted by a year of rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. The New York-based bank posted a profit of $12.6 billion or $4.10 per share. That's up from $8.3 billion, or $2.63 per share from the same period a year before. Analysts expected earnings of $3.41 per share, according to Refinitiv. With $3.67 trillion in assets, JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States and a bellwether for the US economy. \"The US economy continues to be on generally healthy footings \u2014 consumers are still spending and have strong balance sheets, and businesses are in good shape. However, the storm clouds that we have been monitoring for the past year remain on the horizon,\" CEO Jamie Dimon said in a press release. Net interest income rose to $20.8 billion, up 49% from the prior year, driven by the aggressive interest rate campaign the Fed kicked off last year to stabilize prices.   Deposits rose to $2.38 trillion during the first quarter from $2.34 trillion in the quarter ended in December. That comes after the banking tumult last month triggered a rush into big banks from nervous customers. Investors also looked to money market funds as a haven. A key point of conversation after last month's turmoil in the banking sector has been whether banks could tighten lending standards, leading customers to spend less as it becomes more difficult to borrow money for large purchases like homes and cars.  \"Financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending,\" Dimon said, adding that JPMorgan Chase is \"confident that we can serve the needs of our customers and clients in all environments.\" Shares of JPMorgan Chase climbed 6.1% in pre-market trading. The company's post-earnings conference call is slated for 8:30 a.m. ET. Stocks: US stock futures fell ahead of several bank earnings this morning. Investors also fretted a retail sales report that is expected to show consumers are pulling back on their spending. Dow futures were down 75 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures fell 0.2%. Nasdaq futures were 0.4% lower. European stocks were higher and Asian stocks closed up. Fear & Greed Index: 67 = Greed Oil & gas: US oil prices were up 0.3% to $82 a barrel. Average US gas prices rose to $3.66 a gallon. Wall Street is searching for answers to two key questions: Is the economy headed for a recession? And, if so, who\u2019s poised to weather it? Recession fears have ramped up in recent weeks after the\u00a0banking tumult\u00a0last month raised concerns about the financial sector\u2019s health. Earnings season for banks starts on Friday with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, BlackRock, Citigroup and PNC Financial Services slated to report before the bell. Investors will be watching for clues about stability. Stocks have yet to price in the economy\u2019s precarious position, with the S&P 500 adding about 7% this year. But markets have already seen volatile trading since then. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see a correction happen here, because it just never makes sense when the market\u2019s going up and earnings are going down,\u201d says Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth Management. But while earnings are an undeniable factor driving markets, inflation remains a key concern. Wall Street remains overly optimistic that the Fed will cut rates later this year \u2014 even after officials indicated last month that they\u00a0likely won\u2019t\u00a0\u2014 or that it could even orchestrate a soft landing. That hope, and the market\u2019s resilience, could start to crumble in the next few weeks, said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors. \u201cYou very well could see that catalyst over the next couple of weeks with earnings, and then this inflation data and then what the Fed says when they meet,\u201d said Horneman. Jeremy Grantham made his name predicting the\u00a0dot-com crash\u00a0in 2000 and the financial crisis in 2008. Now, the famous investor warns another epic bubble in financial markets is bursting \u2014 and the turmoil that\u00a0swept through the banking sector\u00a0last month is just the beginning. \u201cOther things will break, and who knows what they will be,\u201d Grantham told CNN in an exclusive interview. \u201cWe\u2019re by no means finished with the stress to the financial system.\u201d Since early 2022, when the S&P 500 hit an\u00a0all-time high, US stocks have dropped about 15% as central banks have jacked up borrowing costs. But Grantham sees much steeper declines on the horizon. The \u201cbest we can hope for,\u201d he said, is a fall of about 27% from current levels, while the\u00a0worst-case scenario would see a plunge of more than 50%. The low point might not arrive until \u201cdeep into next year,\u201d he added. Grantham sees uncomfortable parallels between markets today and 2000, when an explosion in the price of tech stocks was followed by a dizzying crash. There are also echoes of 2008, when a painful comedown in the US housing market almost broke the banking system. What\u2019s even more worrying is that this time, bubbles in the stock market and the real estate market are poised to burst simultaneously, Grantham said. The broader US banking system remains sound and stable, but the two regional banks that failed were \u201cpoorly managed\u201d and \u201ctook unacceptable risks,\u201d White House economic adviser Lael Brainard\u00a0told CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow\u00a0in an interview Wednesday at Semafor\u2019s World Economy Summit in Washington, DC. Last month\u2019s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank\u00a0roiled markets and spread fear through the economy of a possible wider banking crisis. The US Treasury, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation all intervened to ensure bank customers could access all their money and to attempt to stave off future bank runs.\u00a0 \u201cThe banking system, it\u2019s very sound, it\u2019s stable; the core of the banking system has a great deal of capital that was put in place in the wake of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis,\u201d said Brainard, director of the White House National Economic Council.\u00a0\u201cThere were some banks who were not managing their risks effectively. They failed, and the president took strong actions along with the Secretary of the Treasury and the banking regulators,\u201d she said. \u201cThose actions reassured Americans their deposits are safe, the banking system is sound; but it was also important to the president that the executives of those failed banks were held accountable and, very important, that taxpayer money not be at risk,\u201d she continued. Before its collapse last month, Silicon Valley Bank was known to investors of color as a place that fostered a community of minority entrepreneurs and provided them with both social and financial capital. SVB regularly sponsored conferences and networking events for minority entrepreneurs, and it was well known for funding the annual State of Black Venture Report spearheaded by BLK VC, a nonprofit organization that connects and empowers Black investors. \"When other banks were saying no, SVB would say yes,\" said Joynicole Martinez, a 25-year entrepreneur and chief advancement and innovation officer for Rising Tide Capital, a nonprofit organization founded in 2004 to connect entrepreneurs with investors and mentors. Minority business owners have long faced challenges accessing capital due to discriminatory lending practices, experts say. Data from the Small Business Credit Survey, a collaboration of all 12 Federal Reserve banks, shows disparities on denial rates for bank and nonbank loans.\u00a0 In 2021, about 16% of Black-led companies acquired the total amount of business financing they sought from banks, compared to 35% of White-owned companies, the survey shows. \"We know there's historic, systemic, and just blatant racism that's inherent in lending and banking. We have to start there and not tip-toe around it,\" Martinez told CNN. The Financial Services Forum, an organization representing the eight largest financial institutions in the United States has said banks have committed millions of dollars since 2020 to address economic and racial inequality."

			"body": "Great sci-fi films are both fantastical and prescient. They can whisk viewers to a galaxy far, far away or exaggerate real scenarios on a fictionalized version of our planet.  But the genre is at its best when it holds up a \"fun house mirror to our present\" and reveals something about the world in which we live, said Lisa Yaszek, professor of science fiction studies at Georgia Tech.  \"As audiences, we love both optimistic and pessimistic science-fiction films like these precisely because they are virtual laboratories where we can imaginatively experience the best and worst our technologies have to offer in a safe and fun environment,\" Yaszek told CNN. Films such as \"Gattaca,\" \"Her\" and even the horror comedy \"M3GAN\" have predicted what our future might look like if developments in gene editing and artificial intelligence accelerate. Meanwhile, pandemic thrillers such as \"Contagion\" seem even more realistic than they did upon their release after Covid-19 drastically upended the world in 2020. \nHere's what some notable films get right about science and tech \u2014 and what's still the stuff of science fiction.  Gene editing in 'Gattaca' is now closer to a reality  \"Gattaca\" drew inspiration from real events leading up to its 1997 release \u2014 including the Human Genome Project launch in 1990 and the successful cloning of Dolly the sheep, Yaszek said \u2014 and the film imagines a society obsessed with and dictated by genetic perfection. It seems to \"eerily anticipate our own society's current fascination with at-home genetic tests like 23andMe,\" Yaszek noted, as well as recent advances in gene editing that hold promise for human health.  In the movie, genetics decide social class. Gene editing becomes the norm, and characters who are born without it are considered \"in-valids\" with a greater potential for hereditary disorders than \"valids,\" humans genetically engineered to avoid those illnesses. Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke), an \"in-valid\" cleaner at an aerospace facility, uses genetic material such as fingernails and urine from paraplegic former Olympian Jerome Morrow (Jude Law) to fraudulently join an interplanetary mission reserved for \"valids.\" \"Gattaca\" came out about 15 years before the introduction of CRISPR-Cas9 as a tool used to make precise edits to human DNA. Though it's mostly been used for research purposes, CRISPR-Cas9 has appeared to make a notable difference in genetic disorder treatment: A woman named Victoria Gray said her sickle cell disease symptoms were significantly alleviated after scientists treated her using CRISPR, CNN reported in March. Scientists removed premature cells from Gray's bone marrow and modified them. The gene-edited cells, once returned to Gray's body, appeared to have produced fetal hemoglobin, a type of hemoglobin that makes it harder for cells to sickle and stick together. Current gene therapy trials \u2014 including the sickle cell trial Gray was a part of \u2014 involve altering nonreproductive cells in what's known as somatic gene editing. But the process of preemptively manipulating the genes of human sperm, eggs or embryos in a way that evokes \"Gattaca\" \u2014 called heritable gene editing \u2014 has raised serious ethical concerns. In 2018, Chinese doctor He Jiankui said that he had modified two human embryos using CRISPR-Cas9 and that the modifications would make them resistant to HIV. The scientific community swiftly condemned his work, and he received a three-year prison sentence in 2019.  'M3GAN' and 'Her' offer opposing views of AI  Society's fascination with artificial intelligence has resulted in no shortage of films that depict both its potential to facilitate a more advanced way of life and the hypothetical horror of AI overtaking humanity. \"These movies tend to reflect both our hopes and fears about our increasing reliance on digital companions,\" Yaszek said.  In Spike Jonze's \"Her,\" Joaquin Phoenix's Theodore falls in love with Samantha, an advanced AI operating system who says she returns his affections. Siri, she is not: Samantha speaks with a human affect and has opinions and feelings, or at least is programmed to. It's the rare sci-fi film that doesn't villainize AI that's able to mimic \u2014 or even genuinely feel \u2014 human emotion.  Samantha does not yet have a perfect equivalent in our own world \u2014 she could even view the physical world through a lens and comment on it, but there are some realistic AI-powered virtual assistants. Popular chatbots such as ChatGPT can closely imitate human speech and have been used to write extensive essays and answer complex questions posed by users, though they aren't perfect. The tech outlet CNET published several articles generated by AI that contained major errors. And AI experts told CNN this year that they fear chatbots could be used to perpetuate disinformation since they're programmed to give users more of what they're seeking and hold their attention. While \"Her\" humanized AI, the 2022 horror hit \"M3GAN\" tapped into viewers' fears. M3GAN is a humanoid doll and caretaker for the young Cady, who loses her parents in a car accident, and the two form a sisterly bond. But M3GAN takes her duties as android big sister dangerously seriously, murdering anyone who threatens Cady or Cady's trust in her.  Yaszek noted that robot caretaking tools are already in use: Nursing homes in Japan have for years employed robots to entertain and engage residents. Studies on whether the quality of elder care has improved in the country are ongoing, but several senior care facilities in Minnesota last year took a cue from Japan and started to incorporate robots built by University of Minnesota Duluth experts into residents' care routines.  There are independent robots that deliver food, perform stunts at Disney's California Adventure and dispose of bombs on behalf of police departments. Commercial robots are nowhere near as lifelike as M3GAN. But her AI capabilities \u2014 known as artificial general intelligence, which describes a bot's ability to learn anything a human can \u2014 are closer to being a reality, said Shelly Palmer, a Syracuse University professor of advanced media and an expert in emerging tech, in an interview with CNN in January. \"We may be both grateful for these tools but also a bit worried,\" Yaszek said. \"What happens if these marvelous new technologies break down and leave our loved ones more vulnerable than ever before? Pandemic preparedness in 'Contagion' rings true During the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, many turned to Steven Soderbergh's \"Contagion,\" a 2011 film that depicts the stunningly quick spread of a deadly virus across the world. Upon its release, a scenario in which the world could change so drastically in a matter of days or weeks seemed unlikely. But when Covid-19 sent much of society into isolation in 2020, \"Contagion\" seemed like a prescient example of what a pandemic response could look like.  Even before Covid-19, experts at the Argonne National Laboratory, operated by the US Department of Energy, praised the film in 2012 for accurately portraying the rate at which a society would experience shortages of resources and the collective effort it takes to address a rapidly spreading virus.  Kelly McGuire, associate professor of English at Trent University in Ontario, wrote in 2021 that \"Contagion\" presents the development of a vaccine as the \"end point of the arc of pandemic,\" when, in our Covid-19 reality, the virus may never be eradicated despite the widespread availability of Covid-19 vaccines and boosters.  Though the Covid-19 vaccine has prevented more than 3 million deaths, according to one 2022 study, hundreds of thousands of Americans continue to be infected with the virus and thousands die monthly, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Immunocompromised people and those who haven't received the vaccine remain at a higher risk of serious illness and death.  Reality has often surpassed the bounds of sci-fi, said Melissa Monique Littlefield, a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who teaches courses on sci-fi and speculative fiction. Even when our reality feels stranger than fiction, though, stories such as \"Gattaca,\" \"M3GAN\" and \"Contagion\" still have something valuable to say about the world in which we live and where it could head. \"(Sci-fi) doesn't simply predict or merely comment on scientific discoveries or technological phenomena,\" she said. \"Instead, it offers us the opportunity to continually evaluate ourselves, our societies, and our assumptions about the world.\"",

			"body": "As a two-day inferno fizzles out at a plastics recycling plant a state judge deemed a public health hazard, up to 2,000 residents of an eastern Indiana city are still waiting to learn whether it's safe to go home. Residents on Friday remained under an evacuation order and officials will meet Saturday to see the numbers from air and water samples. The results will determine how long the order stays in place,  Richmond Mayor Dave Snow said Friday. \"Although the fire is under control, the site is still very dangerous,\" Snow said, \"I need people to stay away from this location.\" The chemicals hydrogen cyanide, benzene, chlorine, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, were detected at the center of the fire zone -- with \"none ... detected outside of the evacuation zone in the community,\" the US Environmental Protection Agency said Friday, noting firefighters should take precautions. Potentially harmful VOCs were found in six air samples that \"will be submitted for laboratory analysis and results will (be) reported early next week,\" the agency said without detailing where the samples were taken. Particulate matter -- fine particles in smoke -- also was found inside and outside the half-mile evacuation zone, as expected, it said. One of two air samples taken a little more than a mile from the fire site detected chrysotile asbestos in debris, an EPA official said Thursday. Also called white asbestos, it can cause cancer and is used in products from cement to plastics to textiles.  Anyone who may have fire debris in their yard should not mow their lawns until officials can advise more on how to clean it up, the EPA official, Jason Sewell, said. The EPA has been monitoring the air for toxic chemicals from incinerated plastics at 18 spots around the fire site.  \"Any type of plastics that you would imagine was in this facility,\" Richmond Fire Chief Tim Brown said, while the state fire marshal has called smoke plumes \"definitely toxic.\" Brown said Thursday night the fire was under control and added on Friday that hot spots could continue to flare up, so crews will remain at the site throughout the weekend. Sewell said two new contaminants were detected at a hot spot overnight, but when it was extinguished there was no further detection. The billowing black smoke that clouded Richmond this week stirred memories of this year's toxic train wreck in East Palestine, Ohio. High levels of some chemicals from that disaster could pose long-term risks, researchers have said. For the third consecutive day since the fire ignited, Richmond public schools are closed Friday.  \"It's really unbelievable,\" resident Corey McConnell, whose family left their home in the evacuation zone, told CNN. \"Makes me worry about the health of my family, not just today but in the future as well.  \"Who knows how long this could be in the air for?\" While it's not yet clear what sparked the fire, local leaders have shared concerns since at least 2019 that the facility was riddled with fire hazards and building code violations, records show.  \"We knew it wasn't a matter of if, it was a matter of when this was going to happen,\" the fire chief said. Health concerns swell even after fire dies McConnell already could smell fumes when his family left Tuesday night as they saw exhausted firefighters battling the blaze. Resident Wendy Snyder evacuated to a Red Cross emergency shelter but briefly returned home to grab a few belongings, she told CNN affiliate WHIO. That's when she noticed the stench of burning plastic. \"There is a stink in the air when you go outside on our porch,\" Snyder said. \"In fact, it burned my throat because (we) weren't wearing a mask.\" The primary health concern to residents is particulate matter -- fine particles found in smoke -- that could cause respiratory problems if inhaled, said Christine Stinson, executive director of the Wayne County Health Department. N95 masks -- the kind recommended to thwart Covid-19 -- could protect against the particles, but people should leave an area if they see or smell smoke or experience symptoms, Stinson said.  City officials blame plant owner for the fire Richmond officials \"were aware that what was operating here was a fire hazard,\" Snow, the mayor, said Wednesday, accusing the plant's owner of ignoring a city order to clean up the property. CNN has reached out to Seth Smith, the owner of the Cornerstone Trading Group, LLC. The attorney who previously represented Smith in a related lawsuit declined to comment. Smith was contacted by an investigator Tuesday night, Snow said. The blaze began in a semitrailer loaded with plastics, then spread to surrounding piles of recyclables before eventually reaching the building, which was \"completely full from floor to ceiling and from wall to wall,\" Brown, the fire chief, said. When firefighters arrived, he said, they had difficulty reaching the buildings because access roads were blocked by piles of plastic.  \"Everything that's ensued here -- the fire, the damages, the risk that our first responders have taken and the risk these citizens are under -- are the responsibility of that negligent business owner,\" Snow said. Firefighters tried not to destroy potential evidence that might help determine the cause, Brown said. That conclusion probably won't be reached until investigators can safely enter the plant, the state fire marshal's office has said.   Any legal liability against the plant owner will be handled after the cleanup process, city attorney Andrew Sickmann said at the Thursday news conference. \"Whether or not there can be potential criminal liability would be a question for law enforcement and prosecutors,\" he said. The only operation running out of the building before the fire was moving materials out and shipping them overseas as ordered by officials, Sickmann said. \"It's his mess, it's been shown again and again it's his mess,\" Snow said of the owner. \"Everything that's ensued here remains his responsibility.\" The city is tracking all costs of the incident in case of potential litigation, he added. Facility was unsafe, city panel had found Richmond's Unsafe Building Commission in 2019 had found the \"cumulative effect of the code violations present\" at the recycling facility rendered \"the premises unsafe, substandard, or a danger to the health and safety on the public,\" according to meeting minutes obtained by CNN.  During a commission hearing, Smith admitted one of the buildings on the property had no fire extinguishing system, the records show.  After Smith was ordered by the city building commission to repair or demolish and vacate his properties in 2019, the plant owner and his company petitioned a court to review the order.  An Indiana circuit court judge ruled in favor of the city in March 2020. The court found in part Smith's properties \"constitute a fire hazard; are a hazard to public health; constitute a nuisance; and are dangerous to people or property because of violations of statute and City Ordinance concerning building condition and maintenance.\" The city last year seized two of the three land parcels the recycling plant sits on after Smith failed to pay property taxes. It removed vehicles from the site but couldn't take away other materials because the business owner objected to them being removed and disposed of, Sickmann said. \"Additionally, a bank had a security interest in the materials,\" he said. The city struck a deal with the business owner allowing him to \"remove the materials and sell them pursuant to his normal course of business,\" Sickmann said.

			"body": "Uber-luxury brand Herm\u00e8s, best known for its coveted Birkin handbag, reported a double-digit jump in sales as high-income shoppers continue to spend on pricey products. Paris-based Herm\u00e8s said Thursday that sales rose 23% in the first quarter, driven by rising demand in all of its international markets. Sales in the Americas rose 19% off \"good momentum\" in the US and were up 23% in Asia (excluding Japan) as wealthy shoppers in China flocked to the brand. Store traffic in the US also continued to rise, said Eric du Halgouet, executive vice president of finance for Herm\u00e8s, according to a report. The results, along with the quarterly earnings of other purveyors of high-end products, show that some status symbols and big spenders are undeterred by economic uncertainty. Getting a Birkin handbag, which can sell from $10,000 at retail to record premiums of $450,000 at auction, directly from its maker is a difficult feat \u2014 one often achieved through celebrity status or at the least a spending history with Herm\u00e8s. The brand produces only a limited quantity for sale each year. Yet demand remains so high that earlier this month, Herm\u00e8s opened a new manufacturing plant in eastern France. Besides its handmade handbags, the luxury goods company also produces ready-to-wear fashion, silk scarves, shoes, watches and saddlery. Herm\u00e8s isn't the only company with rising fortunes rise during a slowdown in the global economy. Shares in LVMH, the world's biggest luxury group, jumped to a record high after it reported strong first-quarter sales buoyed by the economic re-opening in China. The stock of Europe's most valuable company rose 4.6% Thursday to hit \u20ac875 ($965) apiece, boosting the fortune of its owner Bernard Arnault, already the world's richest man.   LVMH was targeted by opponents of French President Emmanuel Macron's pension reforms on Thursday. Protesters taking part in a nationwide strike against an increase in the retirement age forced their way into the company's headquarters in Paris.  \"If Macron wants to find money to finance the pension system, he should come here to find it,\" Fabien Villedieu, a union leader, told CNN affiliate BFMTV outside the building.   The owner of brands such as Tiffany & Co. and Dior reported late on Wednesday sales of \u20ac21 billion ($17 billion) in the first three months of the year, up 17% from the same period in 2022.  The conglomerate said first-quarter sales in Asia, excluding Japan, were up 14% year-over-year, which represented a \"significant rebound.\" Sales were lifted by the relaxation of coronavirus restrictions in Asia, LVMH said in a statement. China ended its strict zero-Covid policy in December.  \"We registered some pretty nice pick-up in China, which bodes well for the rest of the year,\" Jean-Jacques Guinoy, LVMH's chief financial officer, said Wednesday.  The company's cosmetics lines were still a \"little under pressure\" in mainland China, Guinoy added, though leather goods and jewelry were performing well in the world's second-biggest economy.  \"Overall, we are extremely optimistic,\" he said.  In Europe and Japan, first-quarter sales were strong, rising 24% and 34% respectively, thanks to \"robust demand\" from local consumers and international travelers. In the United States, sales rose 8%.  Stocks in the $460 billion company have rocketed 29% since the start of the year, with the luxury goods market proving resilient in the face of high global inflation and fears that some economies could tip into recession.  Arnault, LVMH chairman and CEO, overtook Elon Musk to become the world's richest person in December, with a total net worth of $198 billion to Musk's $176 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. \u2014 Oliver Briscoe,  Xiaofei Xu in Paris and Parija Kavilanz contributed reporting.",

			"body": "JPMorgan Chase on Friday reported first-quarter profit and revenue that roundly beat expectations. The New York-based bank posted a profit of $12.6 billion or $4.10 per share. That's up from $8.3 billion, or $2.63 per share from the same period a year before, or 52%. Analysts expected earnings of $3.41 per share, according to Refinitiv. The company also guided net interest income to be about $81 billion in 2023, up $7 billion from its previous estimate. With $3.67 trillion in assets, JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in the United States and a bellwether for the US economy. \"The US economy continues to be on generally healthy footings \u2014 consumers are still spending and have strong balance sheets, and businesses are in good shape. However, the storm clouds that we have been monitoring for the past year remain on the horizon,\" CEO Jamie Dimon said in a press release. Deposits rose to $2.38 trillion during the first quarter from $2.34 trillion in the quarter ended in December. That comes after last month's banking meltdown triggered a rush into big banks from nervous customers. Investors also looked to money market funds as a haven. Not concerned about a credit crunch A key point of conversation after last month's turmoil has been whether banks would tighten lending standards, leading customers to spend less as it becomes more difficult to borrow money for large purchases like homes and cars.  But Dimon told investors in the company's post-earnings conference call that he isn't worried about a credit crunch after the banking crisis. \"I wouldn't use the word[s] 'credit crunch,'\" he said in response to a question about whether he was worried that lending would tighten in the bank after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. \"I just look at it as a kind of a thumb on the scale. It just makes the financing conditions a little bit tighter and increases the odds of a recession.\" Still, companies should still brace for the possibility that interest rates remain higher for longer than expected, he said. While the Federal Reserve has signaled that it will pause rates later this year, somewhat easing concerns about climber rates, Dimon maintained that the economy isn't out of the woods just yet. \"People need to be prepared. They shouldn't pray that they don't go up. They should prepare for them going up. And if it doesn't happen, serendipity,\" he said. Limited exposure to commercial real estate JPMorgan Chase said its exposure to office space is limited, as concerns that the $20 trillion commercial real estate industry is the next shoe to drop after the banking tumult linger over Wall Street. \"Given the recent focus on commercial real estate, let me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused in urban dense markets, and nearly two-thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply-constrained markets,\" said Jeremy Barnum, chief financial officer. The commercial real estate industry's woes come after decades of unbridled growth powered by low interest rates and easy credit. That upward trend was interrupted by the Covid pandemic's onset, and then when the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates aggressively last year to stabilize the economy. The shift to working from home has eroded the value of buildings as offices remain vacant or half-empty. Shares of JPMorgan Chase were up 6.7% Friday morning.",

			"body": "What happened in one judge's courtroom in Texas could have drastic effects for the United States' entire drug approval process, experts warn.  US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk's ruling that suspended the US Food and Drug Administration's approval of the medication abortion drug mifepristone was an unprecedented one, the first time a court has bypassed the federal system set up to determine what drugs should be allowed on the market. Regardless of whether the ruling -- or a part of it -- is ultimately allowed to stand, legal scholars, scientists and drugmakers are concerned that the decision could start a trend of drugs being targeted in courts, creating a chilling effect on drug development in the US and hurting patients in the process.  Vaccines, including the Covid-19 shots, antidepressants and psychotropic medicines could be at risk, some said. \"Well, one does not want to be Chicken Little,\" former FDA Commissioner Dr. Jane Henney said Wednesday, but \"I can't imagine that it wouldn't have implications for other products. \"The approval process will be at risk, and it's not just an approval process that patients rely on and providers rely on, it's one that has been considered the gold standard, really, for the world,\" said Henney, who was the head of the FDA when mifepristone was approved. Since the dawn of the 20th century, the FDA has had the sole authority in the United States to regulate drugs. In 1906, the federal government created the agency to enforce the Pure Food and Drug Act, which was instituted to ensure that medicine, food and cosmetics were safe.  Over the years, that authority became more defined.  After elixir of sulfanilamide, a drug used to treat streptococcal infections, killed 107 people in 1937, Congress created the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  Signed into law in 1938 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, it required manufacturers to conduct pharmacological studies to prove that their drugs were safe before they could be sold or advertised. In 1962, drug manufacturers were also required to prove to the FDA that their products were effective. Modern drug approval in the US is a careful and conscientious process. Before any drug goes to market, there are countless hours of research, the work and expertise of multiple scientists, and several layers of oversight for approval.  Until now, the courts have been deferential to the FDA's process and have never overturned an FDA decision on the grounds that the agency misjudged the science, said William Schultz, a former deputy commissioner at the FDA and former general counsel for the Department of Health and Human Services.  \"Any FDA drug approval involves hundreds of judgments by the agency. And if a court feels free just to kind of take a fresh look at each of those, there's a chance that a court will find one of those FDA judgments wrong,\" Schultz said in an online discussion Monday about the impact of the Texas court's ruling that was hosted by Protect Our Care, an organization that advocates for equitable and affordable health care. An 'assault on science' Hundreds of well-known biotech and pharmaceutical company leaders, concerned about the effects of Kacsmaryk's ruling on other drug approvals, signed an open letter Monday in support of the FDA's authority \"to approve and regulate safe, effective medicines for every American.\"  The letter also advocated a reversal of the mifepristone decision from a judge with \"no scientific training,\" saying it \"set a precedent for diminishing FDA's authority over drug approvals, and in so doing, creates uncertainty for the entire biopharma industry.\" In a separate statement, the biotech industry group BIO's interim president and CEO, Rachel King, emphasized the \"dangerous precedent\" the decision sets. \"The preliminary ruling by a federal judge in Texas is an assault on science and the FDA's long-standing role as the authority to make decisions on the safety and efficacy of medicines. For a court to invalidate the approval of a drug that was reviewed and approved more than two decades ago is without precedent. As legal scholars have noted, the courts do not have the medical expertise to make these types of scientific determinations,\" King said. The main lobbying group for the pharmaceutical industry, PhRMA, criticized Kacsmaryk's ruling as undermining the regulatory process.   \"PhRMA has serious concerns with any court substituting its opinion for the FDA's expert approval decision-making,\" said James C. Stansel, the association's executive vice president, general counsel and corporate secretary. Stansel added that such a decision could have a \"chilling effect on the research and development ecosystem.\" The pharmacutical sector is a huge part of the American economy. Of the world's 25 largest phamacutical companies, 10 are based in the US, and most of the others have a large base of operations in the country.  Often, the US market is the first to get access to new drugs, but that could change if lawsuits undermine the regulatory integrity of the FDA process, said Susan Lee, partner in the law firm Goodwin's Life Sciences group and Life Sciences Regulatory & Compliance practice, who works with companies to get drugs approved by the FDA.  \"If there do tend to be more lawsuits like this, I wonder if there might be a little bit of a tendency to not always look at the US as the first market,\" Lee said. \"Some manufacturers may say 'we'd rather go to Europe, where we're not going to be sued on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis.' \" Lee also wonders whether manufacturers will abandon efforts to develop drugs that could be considered unappealing to some, such as those that help women's health or work to prevent HIV. \"I think there are just certain sectors that are already kind of thinking about whether they might also have a target on their back. I've definitely heard that discussed,\" Lee said.  What could be next? The groups at the heart of the Texas case have not disclosed any further plans regarding lawsuits over medications, but experts say they are already hearing concern. \"I've already been getting questions from lawmakers and other people about 'could the Covid vaccine be next?' or other things that may have stigma around it,\" said Dr. Kristyn Brandi, an ob/gyn and abortion provider in New Jersey and a spokesperson for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.   The Covid-19 vaccines have been thoroughly tested and found to be safe and effective, but they're the subject of conspiracy theories and misunderstanding about how mRNA vaccines were tested. Beliefs that the vaccines were tested on recently harvested aborted fetal cells made some people decidedly anti-vaccine. Dr. Lynn R. Goldman, professor and dean of the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University, is also concerned that mRNA vaccines could be targeted soon.    \"There might be people who disagree with some of the technologies that are used by vaccine makers, like the mRNA vaccines, but feeling uncomfortable about a technology is not the same thing as identifying that there is risk,\" she said in the Protect Our Care conversation. Members of the LGBTQ+ community may also be vulnerable, experts say, as activists could target puberty blockers or hormones used in gender-affirming therapy. \"I don't like to do slippery slope, but I'm also very worried about things like gender-affirming care, since there's already been so many laws about that recently in other states,\" Brandi said. There is political pressure against other vaccines, antidepressants and psychotropic medicines, among others, former FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg and former Principal Deputy Commissioner Joshua Sharfstein wrote in an editorial published Thursday in the journal Science. \"If judges begin to dictate the terms of medication access, then others will seek to use ideology and influence to advance their agendas,\" they warn. A 'serious moment' for doctors and patients Goldman said that any legal decision that could undermine the FDA drug approval process would ultimately hurt the doctors who prescribe them and the people who use them.  Doctors don't have time to vet all the studies used to prove that a drug is safe and effective, so they rely on the FDA for this work, she said. Court interference could confuse this process.  \"I think that this is, for doctors, an incredibly serious moment, because up to now, we have been able to trust that an approval by the FDA is a science-based decision and that we can say that if the FDA has approved a drug, that it is safe for us to use,\" Goldman said. A lack of confidence in the drug approval process will ultimately hurt people far beyond the most recent decision, Protect Our Care Chair Leslie Dach says.  \"Confidence that the FDA can do its work is essential for clinicians and patients who depend on it in its decision-making for matters of life and death,\" Dach said.",

View this map to see if you may be impacted by the possible record-setting heat. Here's what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day.  (You can get \"CNN's 5 Things\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Leaked documents A 21-year-old Air Force guardsman is being held in connection with the leaking of classified Pentagon documents that were posted online, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced Thursday. The FBI said in a statement that it took the suspect into custody \"at a residence in North Dighton, Massachusetts, for his alleged involvement in leaking classified US government and military documents.\" The leaked material posted to social media included detailed intelligence assessments of allies and adversaries alike, including on the state of the war in Ukraine and the challenges Kyiv and Moscow face as the conflict appears at a stalemate. Multiple US officials told CNN that the suspect is believed to be the leader of an online group where a trove of classified documents had been posted. 2. Florida flooding Fort Lauderdale experienced the rainiest day in its history on Wednesday, which officials are calling a 1-in-1,000-year rainfall event. The downpour prompted emergency rescues, forced drivers to abandon cars, closed schools and shut down the airport. Preliminary reports indicate the region recorded widespread rainfall totals of more than a foot, while Fort Lauderdale tallied about 26 inches in a 24-hour period, according to the National Weather Service. Hundreds of Floridians were housed in emergency shelters in Fort Lauderdale late Thursday as crews race to clear clogged storm drains and impassable roads. More storms could strike South Florida today with some flood warnings remaining in effect at least through this morning. 3. Louisville shooting The family of the gunman who was killed after he fatally shot five people Monday at the Old National Bank in Louisville, Kentucky, plans to have his brain tested for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, commonly known as CTE, his father told CNN on Thursday. CTE, a neurodegenerative brain disease, can be found in people who have been exposed to repeated head trauma. The family thinks he had three significant concussions during his time playing sports in middle school and high school, his father said. The testing disclosure comes as police try to uncover a motive in the mass shooting, and as more families hold vigils honoring their loved ones who were killed. 4. Abortion Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed a bill that would ban most abortions in the state after six weeks, the governor's office announced late Thursday. The law would make Florida one of the most restrictive states in the country to obtain an abortion and follows moves by other Republican-led states to curb the procedure after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer. Opponents of the legislation are slamming the move, arguing that six weeks is before many women know that they are pregnant. Meanwhile, the Justice Department is set to take an emergency dispute over medication abortion drugs to the Supreme Court, Attorney General Merrick Garland said Thursday. This comes after a federal court said Wednesday that an abortion drug can remain available but placed restrictions on mailing the pill. 5. Ukraine As Ukrainian officials prepare for Orthodox Easter this Sunday, authorities in the region are bolstering security measures ahead of possible Russian attacks over the holiday weekend. Residents are being discouraged from attending church services late at night for the next few days, and many cemeteries will remain closed due to the danger of unexploded mines and Russian shelling. Eastern Orthodox Christians celebrate Palm Sunday and Easter one week after many Christians in the US and other Western countries observe the holiday. Ukrainian officials have warned in the past that Russian strikes may increase around specific dates and holidays. Law enforcement officials in Ukraine said police will use special monitoring centers to look out for any signs of attacks.\u00a0 BREAKFAST BROWSE Still haven't filed your taxes?

			"body": "About 100,000 registered nurses in the US left the workplace due to the stresses of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the results of a survey published Thursday by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing.  Another 610,388 registered nurses, who had more than 10 years of experience and an average age of 57, said they planned to leave the workforce by 2027 because of stress, burnout or retirement. The same was true of 189,000 additional nurses with 10 or fewer years of experience and an average age of 36.  The survey found that there were over 5.2 million active registered nurses and 973,788 licensed practical nurses or vocational nurses in the US in 2022. The researchers analyzed data from 29,472 registered and advanced nurses and more than 24,000 licensed practical or vocational nurses across 45 states. More than a quarter of those surveyed said they plan to leave the industry or retire in the next five years, the study says.  About 62% of the nurses surveyed said their workload increased during the pandemic, and 50.8% said they felt emotionally drained at work.  Almost half of nurses said they felt fatigued or burnt-out: 49.7% and 45.1%, respectively. These concerns were seen most in nurses with less than 10 years of experience.  Maryann Alexander, chief officer of nursing regulation at NCSBN and one of the authors of this study, said she is shocked by the findings of the study, especially related to younger nurses.  Soon, the industry will rely on nurses with less than 10 years of experience to act as mentors, managers and leaders in nursing care, Alexander said. \"It will send us into a health care crisis of huge proportions,\" Alexander said.  She said that while it is common to see young nurses leaving the industry to go back to school and get more education,  it is uncommon to see young nurses leaving due to stress and burnout.  \"That is a huge cause for concern,\" Alexander said.  This exhausted tone was a driving factor behind a strike in New York in January, when over 7,000 nurses took to the streets to call attention to staffing shortages and burnout.  \"We are sick and tired of the hospital only doing the bare minimum,\" said Danny Fuentes, a union official who spoke to the crowd during the strike. \"Time and time again, we are forced to take unsafe patient loads. We are humans, and we are burnt-out. And we are tired. And the hospital doesn't seem to care. All they see are profits. We don't want to be out here. We would much rather be with our patients. We need a fair contract to protect our patients.\" The strike ended when the New York State Nurses Association reached tentative deals with the two hospitals involved, Mount Sinai Health System and Montefiore Health System. The union said the deal would provide enforceable \"safe staffing ratios\" for all inpatient units at Mount Sinai and Montefiore.  Montefiore agreed to financial penalties for failing to comply with agreed-upon staffing levels in all units. The researchers on the new survey say their findings pose a threat to the US workforce, especially among younger and less experienced nurses. The National Council of State Boards of Nursing says hospitals and policymakers should be quick to enact solutions and address these challenges.",

			"body": "Xi Jinping has had a busy couple of weeks. Since late last month the Chinese leader has hosted heads of state and government chiefs from Spain, Singapore, Malaysia, France and the European Union -- an unusual pace of diplomatic activity that comes as countries look to Beijing as the global economy sputters in the wake of the pandemic and war in Ukraine. On Friday, that list grew to include Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who is expected to sign a host of bilateral deals with Xi -- and, like several of the leaders before him, arrives with hopes of making progress toward ending Russia's war in Ukraine. But for Xi, this revolving door of visiting leaders -- making the trip even as China has refused to condemn the Russian invasion -- is also an opportunity to assert his vision for a global order not dictated by American rules -- and push back against perceived threats. That's especially urgent for the Chinese leader now, observers say.  Three years of scaled-back diplomacy due to China's strict Covid-19 controls coupled with economic challenges, entrenched competition with the United States and rising European concerns about Beijing's foreign policy have left Xi under pressure to act. \"(Chinese leaders) believe it's time now for China to make its strategic plans,\" said Li Mingjiang, an associate professor of international relations at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University. \"A potentially good outcome is to weaken American alliances ... so that's why we're seeing quite strenuous efforts made by Beijing to try to stabilize and improve relations with European countries, and also to try to improve and strengthen cooperation with emerging economies,\" he said. Driving a wedge As world leaders return to Beijing despite international concerns over the growing China-Russia relationship and Beijing's intimidation of Taiwan, Xi has used the opportunity to thread his conversations with veiled criticism of the US and keywords that signal Xi's own view for how to reshape global power.  Speaking to Singapore's Lee Hsien Loong late last month, Xi stressed that Asian countries together should \"firmly oppose bullying, decoupling or severing industrial and supply chains,\" while he urged Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim to \"resolutely resist the Cold War mentality and bloc confrontation.\"  To Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez that same day, he warned that the \"sound development of China-EU relations requires the EU to uphold strategic independence,\" according to readouts from the Chinese side. Beijing has watched uneasily as the war in Ukraine has driven the US and its European allies closer. Now, analysts say playing up its economic partnerships and exploiting differences between countries on the two sides of the Atlantic is key. When French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Beijing last week, Xi drew comparisons between China and France: both \"major countries with a tradition of independence,\" Xi said, and \"firm advocates for a multi-polar world\" -- or a world without a dominant superpower. After a day of meetings in Beijing, Xi met Macron in the southern commercial hub of Guangzhou to continue an \"informal\" conversation -- sipping tea and listening to the plucked melodies of traditional Chinese music before a state dinner. Macron, who has long advocated for Europe to develop an independent geopolitical policy and defense capabilities that needn't rely on Washington, appeared receptive.  He released a 51-point joint statement with China outlining cooperation on areas from nuclear energy to food security and told reporters traveling with him that when it comes to the US-China rivalry Europe must not be \"caught up in crises that are not ours, which prevents it from building its strategic autonomy,\" according to a Politico interview.  Macron's comments have sparked backlash in Europe and the US, but analysts say they were likely seen as a triumph in Beijing. \"Everything that can weaken the US, divide the West and move countries closer to China is good for Xi,\" said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of political science at Hong Kong Baptist University. \"Hence, Macron's trip is seen in Beijing as a major victory.\"  Lula's back Xi may be preparing for another potential diplomatic win when he meets Lula on Friday.  The leftist Brazilian leader, who ushered in a boom in China-Brazil trade ties during his first stint in power some two decades ago, is traveling with a delegation of business leaders, state governors, congressmen and ministers, and expected to close a raft of bilateral deals from agriculture and livestock to technology. Lula's return to power already shifts the dynamics of the China-Brazil relationship, which saw tense moments under former leader Jair Bolsonaro, who embraced anti-China rhetoric. Lula has already started out his state visit in Shanghai with a nod to Brazil and China cooperation, attending the former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's inauguration as head of the New Development Bank of BRICS, the bloc of emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa that offers an alternative power grouping to the Western-centric G7. \"Xi will find in Lula a BRICS enthusiast, openness to reforms in the global governance system and the desire to avoid automatic alignment with the US,\" said Luiza Duarte, a research fellow at American University's Center for Latin American and Latino Studies in Washington. Meanwhile, Lula's expected warm welcome in Beijing \"raises comparison with his frustrating less than 24-hour visit to Washington,\" she said, referring to the Brazilian leader's February 10 visit to the White House.  The meeting was seen at the time as a key outreach from the newly inaugurated Lula to the US. But Beijing may use the \"lack of deliverables\" from that meeting \"to position itself as a more appealing alternative for bilateral cooperation,\" said Duarte. Ukraine question Looming over diplomacy in Beijing is the Russian assault in Ukraine. Some leaders -- like Macron -- have viewed Xi, a close friend and diplomatic partner of Russian President Vladimir Putin, as a potential ally that could help push Putin toward peace.  But their relationship has also raised concern, with US officials earlier this year warning that China was considering providing the Kremlin with lethal aid -- a claim Beijing has denied. While France and China agreed to several points related to the war in their meeting -- including opposition to attacks on nuclear power plants and the protection of women and children -- Macron did not ultimately push Xi to commit on paper to any position China has not already publicly said.  Brazil, in advance of Lula's trip, has offered another view: creating -- as the country's foreign minister put it -- \"a group of mediator countries\" including China. But how Beijing navigates these initiatives, observers say, comes down to a bottom line that's integrally related to Xi's global ambitions and world view. \"It will be difficult for China to respond positively to some of the requests made by either the Americans or Europeans, because doing this would produce the risk of making the Russians upset,\" said Li in Singapore. \"Russia is the only major power that shares a lot of (China's) views on how the world and the global system should look and how various political issues should be handled. Russia is irreplaceable for China,\" he said. That point was highlighted in another moment on Xi's recent diplomatic agenda: his travel to Moscow in March for his own state visit -- the first since he stepped into a third presidential term that same month. And while China's diplomacy -- and deals -- in the past week may not have been heavily impacted by the optics of that relationship, analysts say how Beijing handles the conflict will continue to affect views on China globally. Perceptions about Xi's potential influence over Putin have provided \"leverage that allows (Xi) to get a lot of attention, and perhaps get mileage and support that he would otherwise not have,\" said Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore. \"Ultimately, the test will come down to whether Xi is actually able to exert any real influence on Putin, especially in terms of ceasing the war,\" he said.",

			"body": "Some South Korean youth are so cut off from the world, the government is offering to pay them to \"re-enter society.\" The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family announced this week that it will provide up to 650,000 Korean won (about $500) per month to isolated social recluses, in a bid to support their \"psychological and emotional stability and healthy growth.\" About 3.1% of Koreans aged 19 to 39 are \"reclusive lonely young people,\" defined as living in a \"limited space, in a state of being disconnected from the outside for more than a certain period of time, and have noticeable difficulty in living a normal life,\" according to the ministry's report, citing the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs. That makes up about 338,000 people across the country, with 40% beginning their isolation in adolescence, according to the ministry. Various factors are thought to be at play, including financial hardship, mental illness, family problems or health challenges. The new measures specifically target young people as part of the larger Youth Welfare Support Act, which aims to support people extremely withdrawn from society, as well as youths without a guardian or school protection who are at risk of delinquency.  The monthly allowance will be available to reclusive lonely young people aged 9 to 24 who live in a household earning below the median national income -- defined in South Korea as about 5.4 million won (about $4,165) per month for a household of four people. The youths can apply for the program at a local administrative welfare center; their guardians, counselors or teachers can also apply on their behalf. \"Reclusive youths can have slower physical growth due to irregular living and unbalanced nutrition, and are likely to face mental difficulties such as depression due to loss of social roles and delayed adaptation,\" the ministry said, stressing the importance of \"active support.\" The report on Tuesday detailed several case studies, including one young student who had suffered from mental health issues and difficulties socializing since adolescence; she struggled to adjust to college, ultimately choosing not to attend, and withdrew further into herself.  Another student faced domestic violence and hunger at home -- making it difficult for her to leave the house or form relationships with people outside. Neither individual was identified. The report also detailed future plans for further action, such as distributing guidelines to local governments, boosting youth social safety nets and early detection systems, and working more closely with youth welfare facilities like shelters or rehabilitation centers.  Some cities and local governments already have similar systems in place; Seoul, the country's capital, has a \"Reclusive Youth Support Project\" that provides mental health counseling, hobby development and work training, and life coaching for isolated young people.  This phenomenon isn't unique to South Korea. Japan has a similar problem, with nearly 1.5 million reclusive lonely young people, who are known as hikikomori, according to a recent government survey. Some go out only to buy groceries or for occasional activities, while others don't even leave their bedrooms. The phrase was coined in Japan as early as the 1980s. Authorities in that country have expressed increasing concern over the issue for the past decade, but Covid-19 has made things worse, the survey found.  Of those surveyed, more than a fifth cited the pandemic as a significant factor in their reclusive lifestyle. Other common reasons cited were pregnancy, job loss, retirement and having poor interpersonal relationships.",

			"body": "The nation's largest employer says it's time for employees to return to the office more regularly, offering the latest salvo in America's work from home battle. The Biden administration on Thursday detailed new guidance for a return to work for federal employees, making clear that they must \"substantially\" increase in-office work. The guidance called on each department and agency to formulate its own plans based on their organization's needs, but stopped short of calling for any specific requirement. \"The guidance we are releasing today directs agencies to refresh their Work Environment plans and policies\u2014with the general expectation that agency headquarters will continue to substantially increase in-person presence in the office\u2014while also conducting regular assessments to determine what is working well, what is not, and what can be improved,\" Jason Miller, the deputy director of the White House Office of Management and Budget said in a blog post explaining the new guidelines.  The plans to return the workforce to more regular in-person attendance come as the federal pandemic response is coming to a close, with programs winding down as the public health emergency is set to end May 11. \"One year after agencies completed reentry, and with the planned conclusion of the public health emergency, it is the right time for agencies to assess their work environments, reflecting on what they have learned as they build routines for measuring and monitoring organizational health and organizational performance,\" White House Office of Management and Budget director Shalanda Young said in a memo sent to the heads of executive departments and agencies.  Young added, \"It is the expectation that as a part of these assessments agencies will continue to substantially increase meaningful in-person work at Federal offices, particularly at headquarters and equivalents, while still using flexible operational policies as an important tool in talent recruitment and retention.\" Young's memo called on each department to update \"work environment plans,\" to \"establish routines to assess and optimize such changes,\" and \"identify a set of indicators\" to monitor workforce health and performance. There will be efforts to share best practices and also to hold underperforming agencies accountable. There are specific steps each agency must complete within 30, 60, 90, and 150 days of the memo's Thursday release. There are about 2 million federal employees spanning all aspects of government, from Transportation Security Administration employees at the nation's airports, to West Wing staffers, to NASA scientists, to your neighborhood postal service worker. Many members of the federal workforce were never given the option to work from home during the Covid-19 pandemic over the past three years. But Thursday's guidance is likely to disproportionally impact those working in the Washington, DC, metro area, where 14.7% of the federal workforce is based, according to data from the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service.  DC Mayor Muriel Bowser used her third inaugural address earlier this year, in part, to call on the Biden administration to get more DC federal workers back into their buildings -- an important revenue-generator for surrounding businesses struggling in their absence. \"The federal government represents one quarter of DC's pre-pandemic jobs and owns or leases one third of DC's office space,\" Bowser said in her January speech. \"We need decisive action by the White House to either get most federal workers back to the office most of the time or to realign their vast property holdings for use by the local government, by non-profits, by businesses and by any user willing to revitalize it.\" Though 61% of US workers \"do not have jobs that can be done from home,\" many American workers have come to take advantage of a hybrid work arrangement: \"41% of those with jobs that can be done remotely are working a hybrid schedule... up from 35% in January 2022,\" the Pew Research Center said in a March report.  Previous guidance from the Office of Personnel Management had called on agencies to \"start re-assessing schedules for and frequency of telework, based upon the experiences of the last 15 months, and re-establish them in a way that best meets mission needs (including the agency's ability to compete for qualified candidates and retain talent).\"",

			"body": "Walmart plans to close half its stores in Chicago, a reversal of the retail giant's high-profile commitment in 2020 to expand in the city as part of its corporate racial justice initiative in the wake of George Floyd's murder by police. Walmart announced Tuesday that next week it will close four poor-performing stores out of the eight it operates in Chicago. Three of the locations are located in Chicago's South and West Side neighborhoods, which are predominantly minority and have long struggled with grocery and retail access. One of the stores is in Chicago's North Side, which is predominantly White and more affluent. The announcement comes after Walmart highlighted its efforts in Chicago as a \"critical part\" of its broader $100 million pledge to advancing racial equity in 2020.  \"Chicago will be an example of what's possible when we leverage business, government and community organizations for the good of all,\" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in 2021. It also follows more than a decade of intense efforts by Chicago political leaders to draw Walmart and other chains to underserved areas to spur economic development. But Walmart said Tuesday that these four stores lose tens of millions of dollars a year and that annual losses have nearly doubled in the last five years. The company said it tried several strategies to improve the stores and invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the city. \"Unfortunately, these efforts have not materially improved the fundamental business challenges our stores are facing,\" Walmart said in a blog post. The company said workers in these stores will be eligible to switch to other Walmart stores and it will work with local leaders to help find reuse options for the buildings.  Walmart said its remaining four Chicago stores \"continue to face the same business difficulties,\" but it believes closing these four will give the others the best chance of staying open. The closures call attention to the recent pullback in major US cities by Walmart and other national chains. They also raise questions about the effectiveness of government strategies that closely rely on national chains to improve food and retail access in underserved areas. David Merriman, a professor of public policy, management and analytics at the University of Illinois Chicago, found in a 2012 study of Walmart's impact in Chicago that businesses closer to Walmart were significantly more likely to close than similar businesses farther away. The study also found that the number of jobs lost by nearby retail competitors essentially offset the number of jobs created at the new Walmart stores. \"Communities around the city shouldn't see Walmart or other big-box retailers as a panacea for local economic problems,\" he said. 'An example of what's possible' In 2020, Walmart temporarily closed all eight of its stores in Chicago during protests in the city and across the country over Floyd's murder by police. There were fears that Walmart and other businesses would leave Chicago, but Walmart pledged to stay and invest in the city.  Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Walmart's McMillon announced in June 2020 that Walmart would reopen its stores and also build two health centers and a training academy for employees in Chicago.  \"Walmart's commitment to Chicago remains strong. We are not going anywhere,\" McMillon said.  He also said at the time that Walmart's stores in Chicago collectively operate at a loss due to a \"combination of our sales, product margin and expenses.\" He said Walmart would try to reduce losses without raising prices or cutting workers' wages or hours.  Walmart \"may have to revisit these decisions again\" if they weren't working after a few years, he cautioned, \"but that's not what we hope for or plan on.\"  A year later, McMillon said \"Walmart wants to serve the people of this great city, build a successful business and work with those who are determined to see Chicago fulfill its potential.\" In a statement Tuesday, Lightfoot said she was \"incredibly disappointed that Walmart, a strong partner in the past,\" was closing stores. \"Unceremoniously abandoning these neighborhoods will create barriers to basic needs for thousands of residents,\" she said. \"I call on Walmart to ensure that these soon-to-be-closed stores are repurposed with significant community engagement so they can find a new use to serve their neighborhoods.\" Struggles in cities Walmart's decision follows years of attempts by the company to move into big US cities. Walmart expanded in rural and suburban areas during the 1980s and 1990s and began to try to enter cities in the early 2000s. But the company was met with stiff resistance in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and other cities from unions and Democratic opponents who worried non-union Walmart would drive down wages and hurt small businesses. In 2006, Walmart overcame opposition in Chicago and opened its first store. Chicago's mayor at that time, Richard M. Daley, paved the way for Walmart by vetoing an ordinance requiring all big-box stores to pay their employees a $10 minimum wage.  Other Chicago leaders saw bringing in Walmart and national chains as a way to boost the economy and provide access to fresh food in Chicago's predominantly Black South Side area. \"This Wal-Mart is a win-win-win \u2014 a win for the local economy, a win for local job creation, and a win for the Chicagoans,\" Chicago's then-mayor Rahm Emanuel said in 2012 when Walmart opened a store in the city's Chatham neighborhood. (It's one of the stores now slated for closure.) But this strategy was misplaced, said Stacy Mitchell, the co-executive director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a research and advocacy organization that challenges economic concentration. She believes the city should have taken stronger efforts to support smaller grocers who have been squeezed by big chains. \"Chicago city leaders bent over backwards to lure Walmart to the city,\" she said. \"What they should have been doing was supporting the development of local businesses with a real commitment to the city and its residents.\"  Walmart is retrenching in some cities. It has also closed stores in Portland, Oregon, recently.  The benefits of Walmart's ability to drive down costs and keep prices low have proven less effective in cities. Walmart's typical 180,000 square-foot supercenter model is not as well suited for urban neighborhoods as it is for suburban and rural areas, said Ray Wimer, a professor of retail practice at Syracuse University.  Walmart is also not the only national chain that has closed stores in major cities. A Whole Foods flagship closed in San Francisco on Monday, citing concerns about worker safety. Walgreens and CVS have also closed in San Francisco and New York, while Starbucks closed 16 locations across various cities. These retailers face several challenges in cities. Urban locations carry higher rents, which means they need to hit higher sales targets to break even, Wimer told CNN. Some retailers have also cited higher levels of theft and other crime in their city stores. In addition, Covid-19 pandemic safety lockdowns and the rise of remote work have hurt foot traffic and sales to stores. And the growth of Amazon and same-day delivery has made going to stores less appealing for urban residents.  Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly identified the location of one of Walmart's shuttered locations.",

			"body": "This past weekend, I had one of the most unusual experiences of my life: a day of air travel that was easy, sensible, efficient \u2014 dare I say pleasant. Passengers and airport staff alike were friendly and polite. The airplane seat offered enough room for both of my legs and both of my arms. We took off on time and landed early. My shoes stayed on the whole time I was at the airport. It was a reminder of what travel could be. It was also in Johannesburg, South Africa, not in the US, and happened under a particular set of circumstances \u2014 a domestic flight on the Saturday afternoon of a long holiday weekend when most travelers had already reached their destinations. I have no doubt that the Joburg airport, like every other major-city air hub, is not always an emblem of efficiency and warmth. But last Saturday, it was \u2014 which highlighted just how unpleasant and undignified air travel often is, particularly within the United States. More than 20 years after Sept. 11, 2001, only passengers who pay for the privilege can avoid removing their shoes and laptops from their bags by submitting their personal information ahead of time and undergoing background checks. Admittedly, I do pay \u2014 I don't want to wait in a long security line, walk my stocking feet through a metal detector and have to un- and re-pack the MacBook I've carefully crammed into my carry-on. But the existence of pay-to-play shorter-line security options like Clear and TSA Pre-Check make clear that it is indeed possible to pre-screen a critical mass of passengers to avoid the morass of cranky people trying to pull on their shoes while re-packing their electronics. Passengers are likely arriving to the security checkpoint already stressed and annoyed, especially when they've made the mistake of trying to get their boarding pass from an actual human. There are often few airline staff to be found at the check-in desk, let alone at the automated kiosks (in our post-Covid era, try not to think about how many other people's filthy fingers have touched those screens) that may or may not fully function. And then there's the bag drop line \u2014 and that extra $30 per bag, if not more, for those who thought they were booking the cheapest ticket. Still, you should be glad. After all, if you've dropped off your checked bag, it means your flight is still \u2014 in theory \u2014 taking off. Earlier this spring, I had the all-too-common experience of showing up for an ultra-early morning flight only to find it had been cancelled, with no text, email, phone call or other notification to let me know. I had been rebooked for the next day, but the airline wouldn't cover a hotel or food, leaving me in the lurch. And I'm far from the only person who has been left high and dry by a flight cancellation. Last year, more than 2% of all flights in the US were cancelled, the highest number of any year in the past decade, excluding 2020 when Covid-19 started raging. So, let's say your flight is still scheduled and you've paid extra money to travel with a bag. You'd be mistaken to believe you're in the clear. We can skip over the gate area of the airport itself \u2014 universally overpriced food, astoundingly inefficient design, generally miserable \u2014 and go right to boarding, where airline policy routinely collides with bad passenger behavior. Boarding groups are a sharp reminder of just how low-status the airlines have deemed most travelers, and travelers seem to swiftly adapt to their new designation by crowding around the boarding gate like livestock jockeying to be first to the dinner trough \u2014 blocking those trying to board, slowing the whole system down. But who can blame them when airplanes simply don't have enough overhead bin space to accommodate all of the carry-on luggage that passengers now bring in order to avoid those extra baggage charges, not to mention the long waits at baggage claim? Once passengers actually set foot on the aircraft, they engage in a \"Will it fit?\" comedy of trying to stuff too-full bags into overhead bins.  The whole process is a nightmare, to say the least, and that's if you're simply traveling alone. Everything from check-in to the TSA line to the overpriced airport food is more painful with a kid (or kids) in tow. Including the airplane seats themselves: Parents routinely cram into these already-tiny seats with an infant, which frankly sounds worse to me than living in Shaq's body for a day and flying coach. Of course, anyone who is taller than 5'2\" or over 120 pounds is likely not enjoying the friendly skies. I'm significantly smaller than the average American woman, and when I fly domestic my knees nearly hit the seat in front of me; my body width fills out most of the seat. How men who could bench-press me manage to fit into what are essentially pitched-forward children's chairs is both a mystery and a testament to human fortitude. The truth is that most American adults do not comfortably fit in airplane seats, and yet airlines continue to make the seats tiny and uncomfortable, forcing passengers to be humiliated \u2014 or to shell out more money just to get a few more centimeters of space. Yes, airlines are struggling with staff shortages and lost revenue due to the pandemic. But air travel was bad well before the pandemic. Airlines also received billions in federal dollars to keep them afloat. And carriers are now returning to profitability, undercutting their rational for stripping away more and more of the basics that make travel tolerable, from food to luggage to reasonable lines. There are some fairly straightforward solutions here. The first is government: stricter rules for airlines, coupled with easing the experience of security checks for all flyers. The government could pre-screen passengers without an extra fee, or \u2014 even better \u2014 revamp security measures and have clear communication available for passengers about why they're necessary. And the government could crack down on the worst airline excesses. It took intervention from the Biden administration to make airlines stop the unconscionable practice of charging parents to sit near their children. This was a good first step. But if flights are delayed or canceled, airlines should have to pay up. The government should also explore minimum standards for seat size and space to make sure that the average US citizen can fly safely and comfortably, even if it costs more to reconfigure planes and reduce seating. I travel a decent amount for both work and pleasure, and because I am not super rich, the indignities of the process never fail to grate. But every once in a while, like this past weekend as I settled into my oversized South African Airways seat without having broken a sweat, I'll see a little glimmer of what air travel could be.",

			"body": "The federal appeals court ruling Wednesday night that is keeping medication abortion drugs available is likely to complicate abortion access across the country, even in places where the procedure is legal. Since the Supreme Court overturned of Roe v. Wade last year, abortion pills -- and the US Food and Drug Administration's rules that allowed patients to obtain them without an in-person visit to an abortion provider -- have become a crucial tool for mitigating some of the burdens abortion clinics have felt after the Roe reversal sent them a flood of patients from states where abortion is now illegal.  Since the FDA approved mifepristone in 2000, it has tweaked the rules around how the pills are administered -- in keeping with updated knowledge around the science and evidence around the drug. The appeals court is now ordering a return to the stricter, pre-2016 FDA regime around the drug. Only in very recent years have patients been able to obtain the pills without picking them up from a provider in person.   The requirement was first paused during the Covid-19 pandemic amid litigation during the end of the Trump administration -- though the Supreme Court let the restriction go back into effect just before former President Donald Trump left office. The Biden administration then took its own steps to halt and later formally remove the in-person pick up requirement.  The access abortion seekers have had to medication abortion via telehealth -- i.e. with virtual visits with their providers rather than traveling to a clinic or hospital in person to obtain the drug -- came as telehealth became a more popular option for medical care generally during the pandemic. The ability to dispense the pills by mail has also relieved the pressure on brick-and-mortar clinics in Democratic-leaning states that have become overwhelmed with patients from Republican-led states where the procedure is banned or severely restricted.  According to one newly published study, 9% of all abortions obtained between July and December 2022 were telehealth abortions, the study's author, University of California-San Francisco Professor Ushma Upadhyay, told CNN.  The ruling might also have an effect on the number of providers who are able to prescribe mifepristone. Because of the administrative and bureaucratic hassles of stocking mifepristone at hospitals and other facilities, some doctors were unable to dispense mifepristone when the in-person pickup requirement was previously in effect, according to court filings submitted in a separate case concerning the mandate. Removing the requirement is believed to have expanded the number of providers able to prescribe abortion pills.  The appeals court is also keeping in place parts of the judge's ruling that will reverse the 2016 changes the FDA made to its instructions for prescribing mifepristone.   Those instructions include how late into the pregnancy mifepristone should be prescribed (from seven weeks to 10 weeks), the dosage amount and whether the patient must be physically with their provider when the drug is administered.  That aspect of the appeals court order is likely to have less of an effect on the drug's use than the revival of the in-person dispensing requirement, which is a mandate related to a specific program -- known as the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy -- used to regulate mifepristone.   The 2016 changes were to mifepristone's label. Providers typically have discretion to deviate from a drug's label. For instance, mifepristone is commonly prescribed to manage miscarriages, but that is an off-label use of the drug.   However, a handful of states have laws forcing providers to prescribe the drug as stipulated on the FDA's label. ",
